2014-01-22,1390408557,I have to say it: airplay rocks! Even with Android.,"tl:dr I have a wife that is an iPhone user. I Started ""outfitting"" the house with Airplay and it's pretty sweet (and works) even if you have an Android.  My story and tip/tricks below. 

*Super sorry for the spelling mistakes, grammar and over all sentence structure. Never been my strong suit and I'm at work :)

My story:
I've learned that if you live with an Apple user and you are looking to buy some sort of tech solution a lot of the time you need to go the Apple route because of Apples lack of compatibility (with others) and Androids resourcefulness.  

About a year and half ago I was in the market for a new router. Having a friend that has installed 4 airport routers in his house so he has airplay everywhere I naturally looked into it.  In the end I bought a new airport express. Just as a router I was very happy with it. It is very Apple like : fast, reliable, great distance and stable but somewhat locked down. No installing of 3rd party firmware. Right away I hooked up the router to my  main floor stereo (via aux cable) with speakers the kitchen, dinning room and living room. Again very Apple like : airplaying  music from my  wife's iPhone worked perfectly. I was very jelly so I started to research ""airplaying from androids"". Naturally devs had accomplished this long ago. 

The app of choice for me after trying out few was [AOA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nav.aoaservice&amp;hl=en) (needs root). Worked super well on my nexus 7 (2012). First thing I noticed about all the Android airplay apps was that you could airplay to multiple airplay receivers at once while ios only can do one at a time. I'm pretty sure this is going to change soon in ios seeing that iTunes ( i know, gross) can airplay to multiple receivers at the same time.  

This got me thinking of ways to outfit my house with airplay on the cheap. Again Android came to the rescue. There are many apps that turn any android device (no root needed) into a airplay receiver. My choice here was [AirBubble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.airbubble&amp;hl=en) .  This app support goes all the way back to Android 2.1. This app plus a cheap ($15) Android phone (hooked up to my wifi) I got off ebay with a cracked screen and bad ESN and an old set up computer speakers now allows me to airplay in the bedroom :)  I've now done this twice (again less then $20 phone off eBay) with a phone that is now in my den hooked up to a stereo. Awesome! 

A new chapter: the Apple TV. Again living with an Apple user for them to get the most functionality I needed to opt for the Apple product.  That is Ok. With the app  [AllCast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast) which allows me to cast all my local  music, pictures and movies to the Apple TV but can't use it to cast music to say an Airport. Personally I'm hoping that  Koush will build out Allcast  so that I can cast both my local and cloud (Google play music) to an airplay receiver and get rid of AOA. AOA works great but there are some compatibility issues with certain devices  like my nexus 5. Side note  -  if you are a a CM 11 user you can mirror you display on the Apple TV. **Thanks to shadvich in the comments it sounds like there is a screen mirroring that doesn't require CM11. It's called [Shou](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2476818)

 My last trick with Airplay: If any had seen the new Rokus they come with a really cool feature. The remote has a headphone jack on it so you can watch a movie (using headphones) and not wake up everyone in the house. I wanted this so bad because my living room TV shares a wall with my bed. Happens often enough where my wife or I want to stay up later and watch a movie while the other wants to get some sleep. Once again people Android comes to the rescue. Apple TVs allow you to send the audio to the to an airplay receiver instead of the TV speakers. Easy enough: I just grab any android device, turn on Airbubble and set the apple TV to airplay the audio to that device. Plug in your head phones and boom done! 

If anyone else wants to share any other tips/tricks I would love to added them to my bag!

**Update** Might be getting some downvotes because i'm praising an Apple made protocol. If that isn't your thing you can take one of those old phones and instead install [Cheapcast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.maui.cheapcast&amp;hl=en) on it. It will show up as a Chromecast which will allow you to play music from certain supported apps. Works just as well as airplay. My only minor annoyances is that it turns on and keeps the screen on. I'm sure that can be fixed with an app or xposed. 

**Update #2** Reading through the comments there seems to be a little confusion as a lot of users compare airplay to the Chromecast and think they do the same thing or close.  Quoting Zouden who hit the nail right on the head

&gt;There's a key difference: AirPlay streams audio/video to the reciever, while Chromecast fetches the A/V from a URL that you send it.

Really the huge thing is that with an ios device they can stream ANY audio to an airplay receiver. The app doesn't need to even support airplay. Vs Chromecast (at the moment) since it fetches URLs an app needs to build in support for it. Yes you can do local casting from a chrome browser and even apps like realplayer cloud (videos only i think) but really at the moment since the Chromecast SDK is still not public we are unsure of what it's capable of.

2021-11-09,1636470795,There and back again (with photos): iOS user tries Pixel 6 Pro - quick and dirty experience report,"Hi all!

I thought I share my experience report. I have been using iOS devices ever since my second smartphone, an iPhone 4s, while my first smartphone was the Galaxy Nexus (Android 4).

TL;DR: Good phone, many aspects of the smartphone experience are commoditised across both platforms, and enjoyable to use. Camera inconsistency, my personal preference for less processed photos, and my dislike for the UX paradigms of android with app instances and deep-links let me switch back to iOS though. 47 sample images below in full res. 

I wanted to switch back to Android, mainly because the stance of Apple on NeuralHash and their not-quite-honest approach to online advertising, where they just aim to capture advertising revenues themselves, while wearing the ""privacy"" mantle. Ironic, but I prefer Google's direction of moving towards cohorts, rather than individuals. Anyhow, that's a side note, there would be a lot to unpack, discuss trade-offs, but it's a different topic.

Here are some observations that I didn't like:

* I did not like the overall **user experience** of Android. In particular that apps could be loaded as several ""instances"" and launched from other apps, and how this often breaks the UI paradigms of using the ""back"" gesture to go to a higher level. What I mean: Say you open a deep-link from one app, like an email, to a different app, say a delivery or ride-hail or social media app, then this opens a duplicative instance of the second app. Within that you often can't navigate to the top level of that app, because the back gesture returns you to the first app. You need to go into the app drawer (or launcher) and open the app in its original instance to have access to the top level. This is very egregious and clunky at times. It is particular annoying when you have workflows that work across different apps. E.g. Email, to social media, to browser to pocket. Or camera to photo gallery to cloud storage to sharing via email or messenger. I am not necessarily a fan of iOS in general, but ironically I found cross-app workflows are solved in a much better way.
* Also, the **camera** was most important to me.
   * Unfortunately the camera produces extremely mixed results, with some of the best photos I have seen from a smartphone, and some are subjectively so bad that it spoils it. The ""bad"" (subjective) come out as very over-produced. Extreme contrast in the fine details (often called ""structure"" in editing apps), extreme use of dynamic range increase / HDR processing that makes subjects look very over-processed against an HDR-flavour background that is all mid-tones with high detail contrast. The natural feeling is completely lost where there would be light and shadow areas within a picture. Subjects have clear ""dark edges"" outlines, where the imagine processing is transitioning from background to subject and amplifying the exposure of the dark areas. Compare these three images with quite random variation in over-processing: [https://postimg.cc/PNTjnXB5](https://postimg.cc/PNTjnXB5) and [https://postimg.cc/JyDFZgvg](https://postimg.cc/JyDFZgvg) are both over-processed and taken moments after each other, but the second one is much worse. Similar shot bit later with different light: [https://postimg.cc/5Q4dBgwC](https://postimg.cc/5Q4dBgwC). And two subjects in front of a monument, which was much darker on location: [https://postimg.cc/nsB6Ng2m](https://postimg.cc/nsB6Ng2m)
   * Camera is ""unreliable"", as in you don't know what you get. It turns out that when you zoom in 3.5 that this is a pure digital zoom sampling from the standard-lens. I would have expected this to be a sampled image between the 4x zoom lens and the 1x lens, where the mid area is taken from the 4x lens, and the edges are taken from the 1x lens. (Which is what the iphone is doing). But no, 3.5x zoom is considerable worse than 4x. See, e.g. these two pictures: [https://postimg.cc/xJJ7279Y](https://postimg.cc/xJJ7279Y) and [https://postimg.cc/hhmwZHC1](https://postimg.cc/hhmwZHC1)
      * Camera also struggled with fireworks, where the overproduction was mixed with not selecting appropriate shutter speed for the selected aperture and ISO, so that the photos were over-processed, but also often shaken. This is one of the better photos: [https://postimg.cc/HJZDHX50](https://postimg.cc/HJZDHX50) vs. the worse: [https://postimg.cc/14gPmCv8](https://postimg.cc/14gPmCv8)
      * In many darker situations (indoor) the camera would default to night mode, and therefore would be quite slow, where one had to hold the phone still for a considerable time. this doesn't seem to be the behaviour I am used to from e.g. iPhone 12 Pro Max.
   * 47 Full res pictures here: [https://postimg.cc/gallery/m43kp1j](https://postimg.cc/gallery/m43kp1j)
   * I did like the on-screen controls for the camera, that let you adjust lights, shadows, and temperature, before you take a picture. That was great! If the result would only be less processed though.
* **UI and gesture** glitches:  

   * I found it irritating that the UI and gesture UX overall wasn't smooth at all. The phone had troubles differentiating if I want to switch to the previous app with the swipe-up gesture, or wanted to open the overview of all open apps, or wanted to go back to the home-screen. The different patterns are not distinct enough. Executing the app switching gesture is also quite slow therefore compared to iOS, where the phone just ""gets it"" much quicker if you want to switch to the previous app or have an overview of all open apps. Annoying
   * Overall the graphical glitches and sluggish scrolling experience on Android were still quite off-putting. When you would launch the camera with the double-power button, or when you would push down the notifications, or any other area where the UI would resize or overlay elements, it would be a bit erratic, slow, sluggish and sometimes would create actual UI glitches and apps would get stuck. Annoying too.

Verdict:

It's a good phone, to a big degree the phone experience is commoditised and there isn't much difference across the platforms. I did like the app experience better on iOS (e.g. Twitter, Reddit, browser), I do like the consistency of the camera better on iOS (albeit some Pixel shots are amazing), and overall interaction with the phone much better. I did end up returning my device. I'm a bit sad that Android didn't improve that much in some crucial areas of user experience in the eight OS updates since my Galaxy Nexus. Sight, maybe I will check out Android 20 again :)

2015-05-29,1432923285,A Comparison: Google Photos vs. JPEGmini--how does Google's new compression compare to the gold standard in lossy jpeg compression?,"All,

It seems I'm [a little late to the party](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/37pfn5/ive_made_an_album_comparing_original_files_vs/) discussing Google's new photo compression performance, but perhaps I have something to add.

I've been using a program called [JPEGmini](http://www.jpegmini.com/) for a couple years, now, to compress my JPEG images. Its compression of JPEGs is lossy, but it claims to do so leaving the perceptual image quality virtually unchanged. Far as I can tell, its claims are pretty accurate, and it has literally helped me cut the size of some of my picture folders in half.

As I'm sure most of you are aware, yesterday Google unveiled Google Photos, and with it announced *unlimited storage space* for photos and videos. The unlimited part comes with a caveat: Google will apply lossy compression to your files.

Like JPEGmini, Google claims to be able to apply lossy compression to images without changing the perceptual quality of the image. If you analyze the uncompressed and compressed images with a computer, you can see differences--but by eye, they look identical. 

**So I a did a little test with a bright image to compare JPEGmini's compression with Google's compression.**

Take a look at this image:

* http://imgur.com/xf0BgQX

This shows a comparison between the uncompressed image, Google's compression, JPEGmini's compression, and finally JPEGmini applied to an already Google-compressed image.

You can decide for yourself if there is any loss in visual acuity between the original, the Google-compressed, the JPEGmini-compressed, and the double-compressed image. To make it easier to view the images side-by-side, here's an imgur album with each individual frame, which you can load it separate browser tabs and click back and forth:

* http://imgur.com/a/6S97k

Below, I've produced a table showing the different compression ratios.

Method | Before | After | Compression
:---------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---------------
None | 4.03 MB | 4.03 MB | 0%
Google | 4.03 MB | 2.09 MB | 93%
JPEGmini | 4.03 MB | 1.75 MB | 130%
Google + JPEGmini | 4.03 MB | 1.08 MB | 273%

In my personal opinion, all four images have the same perceptual image quality. Google's method is remarkably good. The reduction in image quality is almost imperceptible, yet it manages to nearly cut the file size in half. On the other hand, JPEGmini manages to eek out an extra 40% compression with only trivial image degradation. Most remarkable of all, though, is that by combining the two--Google and then JPEGmini--it *doubled* the compression even of the already-compressed image! Of course, the double-compressed image has the most notable degradation of image quality, but even so, it is so minor that, I think, it is still almost certainly unnoticeable in large photographs.

Finally, for a more rigorous analysis of the actual differences between each of the four test cases (original, Google, JPEGmini, Google+JPEGmini), I loaded them up in Photoshop and used the *difference* layer effect to calculate the actual changes in the original image that the compression algorithms performed. You can see that, here:

* http://imgur.com/TJA7hix

What should be immediately clear is that Google's compression algorithm was the least degrading by a long shot. The original, uncompressed image was only very slightly altered by Google's method, and yet it still was able to nearly cut the filesize in half. JPEGmini's compression is good, too, eeking out an extra 40% compression over Google's while still causing relatively little damage to the original photo. The biggest jump in image quality degradation is from applying JPEGmini to an already Google-compressed image. No pain no gain, I guess, but even so, I think it exhibits remarkably little degradation consider it is nearly a 100% improvement over either Google or JPEGmini's algorithms alone.

##**edit:**

I redid the comparison with a little bit better image. The original image was just a photo taken on an 2014 Moto X. This time around, I used a studio test image taken by a Nikon D750 DSLR ($2000 camera) taken from [DPReview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-d750/13). Because Google only allows a max photo size of 16 megapixels and the original test image was 24 MP, I downloaded the RAW format shot and resized it down to 16 MP in Photoshop before starting the test.

You can grab the new test images, **[here](https://mega.co.nz/#!aRhkAbSA!JwP40tGQathCTv0imqqViFhj94mySw5FXqbC5blCrI8)**.

And now the updated table

Method | Before | After | Compression
:---------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---------------
None | 4.07 MB | 4.07 MB | 0%
Google | 4.07 MB | 2.43 MB | 67%
JPEGmini | 4.07 MB | 2.70 MB | 51%
Google -&gt; JPEGmini | 4.07 MB | 1.66 MB | 145%
JPEGmini -&gt; Google | 4.07 MB | 1.99 MB | 104%

This time the results are a little bit different, and there are some interesting results. Google's algorithm performs a little bit better, and we see that the best overall compression is still when you perform a Google compression first, and then a JPEGmini compression on top of it. 

Taking a look at the difference maps, we can see that JPEGmini and Google compress the JPEGs a little bit differently. JPEGmini's difference maps are all nearly monochromatic. This means that JPEGmini isn't altering the colors of the original image very much. Google, on the other hand, is altering the colors quite a bit ([example](http://imgur.com/6aRNhmC)). That's not necessarily a bad thing if Google can compress colors imperceptibly.

...But here's the thing--it doesn't. Take a look at the color wheels just to the right of the bottles at the bottom of the original image. JPEGmini compresses these well, but Google creates some nasty outlines around the edges of the circles ([image](http://imgur.com/p2YCpvg)). Other than that, both JPEGmini and Google crush the details in the gray background differently, and I suspect that it's up to personal preference as to which one is better.

Overall, I think Google and JPEGmini both have impressive algorithms. Google's beats JPEGmini in compression some of the time, but it looks like there are still some kinks to work out to prevent aberrations and other artifacts. Nevertheless, I suspect that this is something Google will improve over time. Given that Google has their own web browser and their own mobile OS, they're more than capable of even pushing out new image formats or new standards, if they wanted to. Until then, if you have some important images that you want to save from minor image artifacts, it might be prudent to keep an extra backup outside of Google Photos.

##**edit2:**

/u/men_cant_be_raped brought to my attention [MozJPEG](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg). I followed through with the same kind of comparison on it, which you can see [in my reply, here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/37qz6m/a_comparison_google_photos_vs_jpegminihow_does/crpytq3?context=1). I've also updated the archive of full-sized images, which you can download [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!PNozVapT!Hp8ww7qdVIbreZ_8CgHimTmIDjneSTrlpHapT6M2Ni4).

MozJPEG is really impressive. Whereas JPEGmini's difference map shows a lot of monochromatic changes in the original image, and Google's shows a lot of color changes, MozJPEG does the best of both worlds.  I was able to figure that MozJPEG with a -quality setting of 91 was almost identical to Google's compression in visual quality, and it managed to also shave off a little bit more filesize. MozJPEG -quality 91 came in at 2.33 MB, while it was 2.43 MB for Google, and 2.70 MB for JPEGmini.

Unfortunately, MozJPEG has the same ringing effect on the colored circles, which you can see in this imgur album:

2018-11-15,1542303659,Android vs iOS in depth difference,"Is this the real difference between these two OS?

I always was sensitive to the smoothness and reaction of things. When games were laggy, choppy, when there was a higher ping in games, lower fps etc. I noticed that I really like an immediate reaction and smoothness of things(not only me obviously). And that led me to the curiosity throughout years to observe how the technology works etc..

So my question is, is this a real explanation how these two systems differ?

I asked my friends who are more into the technology, IT guys, who studdied IT, how come I always find iOS more smooth and responsive than any other octa, deca, milioncore Android device when touching the display and observing the response and reactions?

The answer was pretty simple. Somewhere deep in the core of the systems these too pretty differ. There are lets say two threads. 1 - computing thread, 2 - graphic/visual thread. And when you touch the screen on iOS, it kind of stops or lowers the 1 - computing one and transfers all the performance to the 2nd one 2 - visual one. Making the experience as respsonsive as possible. The reaction is immediate. That can be seen that the speed and accuracy the iOS system handles your gestures when zooming and sliding photos, browsing the internet, clicking buttons etc.   
Unlike Android device, Android system cannot leave the first one or the second one behind. It always runs both at the same time, making the experience a little bit slowed. I mean even nowadays when the response time from the screen and reaction of the system made a huge progress, I still know and I can still say it is not as responsive and smooth as is the iOS system.   
The content in the iOS screen will always be followed better and with far better accuracy than the content in the Android device and I think this is the answer. Somewhere deep in the systems these two differ in leaving one thread a little bit behind and putting the performance to the responsivity. Android cant do that.

Is someone here who know the stuff and could make my curiosity prove right or is the issue in something else? Please dont blame me I dont hate Android devices, I just prefer different behaviour and I have different practical arguments to have some system in my smartphone :-)",Android,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9xdd2n/android_vs_ios_in_depth_difference/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_ios,,,,,,,,

2015-06-30,1435681785,[Android Wear Discussion] Pebble Time vs. Moto 360,"Hello all,

I wanted to sit down and talk today about the Pebble Time. It's finally seeing some distribution, and I've seen a few people rocking it from the Kickstarter page in my IT office. It looks nice, but I wanted to highlight some of the pro's and con's of each to compare the almost similar pricing of the two now. I've owned the Moto 360 for about four months now, and have used it every day since purchase. I've only played with a few of the Pebble's around the office, but I'm very intrigued by the design of the hardware, and the style of the OS.

**The Moto 360**

* Round display that's a bit larger, and more importantly LCD, touchscreen, and has very small bezels despite the flat tire.
* Official Android Wear support, supports wear applications, and features. Ability to view Google Now cards, prompt a voice search, and give actions to the OS which trigger functions on your smartwatch. A true Android companion.
* 1 Day battery life. From 8am to 2am usually, I'm left with about 30% left on the watch, if not more. It COULD get you through two days, but that'd be one hell of a stretch.
* The processor, yes it's outdated and ""slower than others"", you REALLY don't notice it as much as people seem to feel the need to highlight. Android Wear processes minimal tasks to begin with. Scrolling through most google cards you see no stutters, lag, etc. The only time I've found ANY disruption was from the time between when the screen is off, to about two to three seconds after turning it on. That's it, nothing else.
* Additional sensors and antenna's - heart rate sensor, WiFi antenna (Not huge, but something to consider if you're leaving your watch at your desk or on a table), and a gyrometer.
* I have to say, I have the Steel edition, and it's beautiful. It truly looks like a regular watch you'd purchase for a much higher price. Fits very well with a business look. Goes well with suits, and the general office environment. 

**Pebble Time**

* Up to 7 day battery life. This is something that seems to average out around four or five days of use amongst a few people in my office. One received the device and had it fully charged last Friday, and had to charge it for the first time last night.
* Features a smaller, square display that albeit looks beautiful. I really think Pebble did a good job designing this watch. It doesn't look like a giant computer (but neither does the Moto 360), but more of a fashion piece at times too. The black edition is minimalistic enough(?) for my taste, but that's always personal preference. The red on black looks really nice. Even in person, it's gorgeous. I feel like this watch almost carries more of a sporty look. Again, more preference here.
* Pebble's own unofficial OS to compete with Android Wear (and the Apple Watch OS, but I'm not comparing these two here). It's got fluid animations, great voice recognition, and overall a fun look and feel to it. It adds a great level of personality to the watch. What the Pebble lacks in functionality, it brings in feel and pleasure with using it. 
* Speaking of lack of functionality: App support. At this point, there are gaps that need to be filled. Developers are making their way to building appropriate apps, but there's a niche to be filled; HOWEVER (this is a BIG however) you need to REALLY think about how you use your smartwatch. The compromise can be seen as less of a compromise when you consider the battery life, and other features. ESPN has a great sports app for event viewing for one example. The watch has incredible calendar viewing functionality, some fun watch faces (these will get MUCH better over time), and weather apps as well. These are the main things I use on my Moto 360, and I don't use much else. Thinking about this, the Pebble can complete all of these tasks in a fluid and fun way.
* Third party watch band support, with easily interchangeable bands. (NOTE: possible addition of smart bands with future development?) 

This is what I've come up with. If you have any other things to add or provide, please let me know. I really want to know what the Android community thinks and how they feel about each watch in particular. They share very similar price points, and I'm curious! I may sell the Moto and try the Pebble in a little while, but in the mean time I want to provide my knowledge to those interested in Android Wear of any sort.

TL;DR: Pebble Time is sporty, and provides personality over functionality. Moto 360 brings a more professional look(?) to Android Wear, and doesn't look like a computer, looks like a normal watch with additional **OFFICIAL** wear support.

2024-06-29,1719697632,Honor Magic6 Pro: Long-term Review,"Hi,

I thought I'd write this review if there's other people out there like me who were looking to invest in a new smartphone and wanted to see what people thought of the Honor Magic 6 Pro. Here's my opinion, which you're fine to ignore or enjoy.

For a full price handset of Â£1100, you should expect a handset that can compete with the best of today's phones. And the Honor Magic 6 Pro is up there with the best. 

Here's the obvious reasons why:
- Latest premium chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) with 12GB of RAM (+8GB Turbo Boost when needed), meaning fast and fluid performance including strong multi-tasking performance and fast responsive. I love Androids for their multi-tasking ability vs iPhones
- Premium, vibrant and large (6.8 inches) FHD+ (2800x1280) display, with accurate colours and enjoyable and comfortable viewing experience. Refresh rate up to 120Hz for buttery smooth scrolling that supposedly dials down to 1Hz when screen is idling to preserve battery, but I've yet to measure this. Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode
- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode
- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.
- Excellent phone reception and sound quality/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3/4/5G to boost your base voice call quality too
- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock
- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight
- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound
- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge
- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour
- While Samsung S24 series have ""circle to search"", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image
- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)
- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub
- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)
- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).
- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off
- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)

However, here's the bits that could be better:
- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump
- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble
- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open
- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications 
- Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.
- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.
- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed
- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better
- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.
- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall
- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds
-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.

Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.

If you're in the market for a premium Android handset, this is one of the best you can get.",Android,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1drlx1a/honor_magic6_pro_longterm_review/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2015-11-30,1448854745,Why do you have an Android tablet?,"I love Android. Only buy Android phones. Love my Android smartwatch, which arguably serves no real useful purpose. And I jumped on the first Nexus 7, convinced I would use it all the time. Problem is, I didn't. And it's starting to show it's age, almost 4 years later. So I was thinking of upgrading to a new one soon. But I'm thinking that I will run into the same problem I had with my last tablet: a lack of need. I am a big reader, and I was really looking forward to using my Nexus 7 as an excuse to really dive into the eBook world. But that ended up not working out. I like to read at night before bed, and a tablet screen is too bright (several studies show that it can mess with your sleep schedule), and in general there are too many distractions on a tablet. As someone with insomnia and ADHD, it's a bad time. Plus I found I really missed the feel of a good book in my hands. If I did try and get into eBooks again, I'd probably get a dedicated e-reader in some kind of e-paper display. I don't really need it to consume media, as my awesome tv does that just fine when I am at home and my Nexus 6 is good enough when I am out and about. Gaming is probably a slightly better experience on a tablet vs a smartphone, but not world changingly different. Etc.

Considering I carry my Android phone and a laptop around with me at all times (unless I'm like going bar hopping or something), I feel like a tablet really doesn't bring anything to the table that those two other devices don't already do, and for the most part do better. I feel this is a problem with tablets in general, that the market is stagnating. They came out strong because of being the hot new thing, but so far have failed to innovate.

So tell me. Why do you have an Android tablet? What killer app can you not live without? What function in your life does it serve that an Android Smartphone doesn't fill?

2018-06-25,1529943639,"Ok for real, how does Android compare to recording ""professional audio with external equipment. Because I keep hearing people demand I get an iPhone or iPad if I want to do that...","By professional audio, I mean connecting mics like shotgun and Lav to your phone. It's not an h4n of course, but when you're on the fly and don't have a recording studio and aren't shooting a feature film.

I decided not to argue because he was kind of my boss in the situation.  But I was discussing recording with this voice actor. He basically explained in voice acting, when there are auditions that show up, you gotta record immediately on the fly and send them off because it's so time sensitive. So basically, outside of the studio when he can't get to it immediately he has his mic connected to his iphone under a blanket in his car. But then he straight up said. ""Do you have an iPhone or iPad. You NEED that if you want to do this""

I didn't want to delve into it because in the past that is some risky territory, and I have no intent on dropping a ridiculous amount of money for a phone that I don't like. I know I'm probably biased for asking it on here, but I would really like to know if people have objective answers to this. Because you can connect a mic to your andoird phone, with USB-C or the jack, and record 44 kHz audio. So honestly, whats the difference other than thunderbolt??

I apologize if I'm just ignorant. I'm not an audio engineer. I know audio quality can make or break a video but I'm still more experienced in filming and post-production. Can anyone enlighten me whether Apple products are legitimately better, or if this is just a biased opinion driven by another person's unconditional love of Apple products? I'm not looking to voice act, just to have external audio for some videos when I can't connect mics to my DSLR or take out/rent/use my heavier equipment, but I've heard this opinion in multiple places and I don't understand what the difference is and why it's so much better...?

Edit: oops, I wasn't clear. My job doesn't depend my my equipment. My boss just keeps basically saying I should pursue voice acting and get an iPhone. I have no interest to pursue voice acting, I am at this job and liking to learn more about it and how voice work pertains to my industry, and I'm not gonna get fired if I don't get the phone--he doesn't think or mean that. I was mainly asking because I am curious about the technology and reasoning behind iPhones vs. Android. Sorry for the misunderstanding!!

2018-11-22,1542860907,Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 with Good Lock 2018 Review: Underrated media/casual laptop beast (comparison with my chromebook pro),"I along with most of y'all (and reviewers) were incredibly skeptical with this device once it was originally announced, laughed at the specs, price and the half baked dex mode. But good lock 2018 changed that, especially with the [recent multistar release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9hl2xl/samsung_releases_a_new_good_lock_module_multistar/) combined with floating window, that really opened up power user possibilities for me, and I was keeping my eyes on the price of the tab s4 to drop. I ended up snagging this excellent condition open box at best buy for $480 and a $100 keyboard case. I also picked up a cheap folio stand case off amazon for $10~. 

So currently I have [3 portables atm](https://i.imgur.com/GejMRlw.jpg), with no real need for a windows laptop besides work one. Got a chromebook pro, [mi pad 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9wwgdt/xiaomi_mi_pad_4_8_2_month_review_my_first_china/), and this tab s4, and i was fascinated to see what the tab could offer, so lets begin. 

* In terms of build, the thing is fairly straightforward. minimal bezels, a good aspect ratio for splitscreen, good buttons, solid build (tried bending with a bit of effort, but no give, and my thumbs hurt). Didn't really need the glass back, but at least it has all the features you expect, like headphone jack, usb-c, expandable memory. Ain't really cutting corners.

* The screen... man this thing is gorgeous. Probably the best screen in the house. I definitely prefer it to my old ipad pro's 120hz lcd. Smooth scrolling is nice... but hard to go back from amoled. Really the only complaint is more related to software. They say the screen is HDR compatible, and the netflix app has the HDR tag for videos, but i'm not noticing a visual switch to hdr, that you usually see on tv's or phones once you open a HDR video. Don't see the option for HDR on netflix or amazon prime either, but regardless watching video on this device is a highlight, and can't really be matched in this size. [It's an excellent way to watch stuff while being lazy in bed.](https://i.imgur.com/RlYZxFY.jpg) 

* The lack of a fp sensor is a bummer. Iris scanner requires you to be really close to the device, and doesn't seem as quick as my note 9. Intelligent scan is slow too, and doesn't work especially well if i'm trying to unlock the device in bed with the lights off.

* Haptics! Never had a samsung tablet before so not sure if its a common feature with their tablets, but you don't often have vibrations in a tablet. Don't think any ipad got it. I generally prefer to keep it on the keyboard and nav buttons on android, so this is a nice unexpected perk.  

* Speakers are good. Not the loudest, but definitely better than my mi pad 4 or the chromebook. No problems with them for content consumption.

* spen is light due to no battery. It not having a slot on the tablet does come with the advantage of it being normal pen size. It's quite nice to write with, and works on other devices that have this tech, including the note 9 and chromebook pro! 

* battery life is good, not amazing idle as with any samsung I own with my apps installed. The tablet does support quickcharge though which is nice. 


So overall, hardware It's about as good as it gets. Software is where it's interesting. 

* Let's first talk about the normal tablet mode, which in short is basically the experience I have as the note 9. Fairly smooth experience with minimal stutters, along with most of the goodies samsung brings to the table in terms of multiwindow, including resizing window in landscape (still not an option in stock pie!), floating window, and [multistar letting multiple apps run active at the same time](https://i.imgur.com/apH69rE.jpg). 
* [the list view app switcher](https://i.imgur.com/qV4Kl1z.jpg) is excellent. 
* [good lock task switcher](https://i.imgur.com/L7CjnlF.jpg) works too if you prefer that.
* Kinda wish you can view the upper notification bar in splitscreen here. It makes sense on phones to get a bit more screen, but the tablets got plenty of space up there...
* [Here is a quick demo](https://i.imgur.com/C8eMs15.mp4) of me just going through the multitasking options.
* I do wish there was more than 4gb ram here... apps do reload a bit more than i'd like, but its less of a big deal with how I use my tablets vs phones. 
* It seems like sidesync isn't supported anymore? Doesn't seem like I can mirror my phone to the tablet anymore like in the past. Flow is pretty lackluster... 
* So overall its a great tablet, and does multiwindow better than what ipad can offer in terms of options and flexibility. 
* This is where the chromebook falls short. The current build is still not prime time for tablet use in terms of animations. Just [look at this](https://i.imgur.com/zTSHsHr.mp4). Not good... And this is regardless of the power of the device. Same laggy animation on the pixelbook, and every preview i've seen of the chromebook slate. Luckily it seems like chromeOS is working hard on this integration so maybe in a year or 2 the situation would be better, but there is still plenty of little issues revolving around app capatability and other little things that need to be worked out( don't think android apps can read data off a sd card yet). Don't go to chromeOS if you want android apps... yet.

So lets talk about dex mode, but before that we need to talk a bit about this funky keyboard case.

*  The case is nicely built, decent material, the keyboard has clicky keys that are a bit harsh, but I can type quickly enough, absorbs grease like crazy though. I probably wouldn't write an essay with it, but you can always pair a bluetooth keyboard or plug in a fullsize one with the usb port.

* [The layout is something](https://i.imgur.com/QLHYTdO.jpg)... Apparently android doesn't support Esc keys? Still getting used to that. Was pretty dang confused about some of the instructions for shortcut keys referencing a META key, which googling told me its that search key on the bottom left haha. Not really sure why they waste a key on Lang, or an on screen keyboard... Would prefer some physical android nav buttons. Also the top num row keys being smaller than the rest really trips me up when I type. I often hit - when I want to get 0. 

* The keyboard case also has this really strange behavior in terms of it not waking when you open the case (as with any other cover case for tablets these days, including my other case), but only when you connect the case to the keyboard pins at the bottom. The device also locks when you remove the tablet from the keyboard connector, which is mildly annoying if you want to quickly go from 'laptop mode' to fold the keyboard back for normal tablet mode. Here is a [quick demonstration](https://i.imgur.com/OcbpKYy.mp4) (Crotch shot is me trying to get intelligent scan to see my face haha). I can see why they want to do this, but the execution is poor.

* Anyways this is pretty much the first time I really put any time on using a physical keyboard with android, and generally things work as you'd expect with any other os. Chrome supports most of the same keyboard shortcuts like on windows. alt tab works. You can do search + [ or ] to enable splitscreen similar to chrome OS. Honestly with how powerful multiwindow is already, I often just use the keyboard without enabling dex, just fine. Heck I can even print stuff, which my chromebook always has issues with connecting to my canon printer.  Really not much chromebook offers over this in terms of my usage besides some extensions, and I prefer google docs web over the apps. 

Let's talk Dex mode then.

* I've played around with this on my note 8 and 9, and found it... more of a cool concept but limited in its own way. My opinion hasn't changed too much since, but there is definitely some potential. Not sure if its due to multistar, but apps seem to just be more stable now in this space. Netflix still needs to restart if you resize though. Everything is pretty damn tiny, which kinda forces you to use a [mouse](https://i.imgur.com/3Vx8EjY.jpg) or the stylus... which works better than you'd think. 

* [I do love the app switcher.](https://i.imgur.com/9b0Q8cm.jpg) 

* The bottom area is... weird. Like you can hide the tools to see more apps on the tray like in the picture on the last bulletpoint, or you [can expand it](https://i.imgur.com/C9DzYqH.jpg), but then there is just way too much crap. Wish I could just configure what I see, like on windows.

* There are other limitations in this mode too, like you have to use samsung keyboard. Custom wallpaper apps are finicky too.

* switching from tablet to dex takes a few seconds and apps need to refresh, so its not as seemless as one would hope. 

* keyboard shortcuts seem to change too which is confusing.... Search + left and right snaps windows to place now. 

* apparently there is some linux beta now too? Haven't messed with that yet, but there is potential there for some tomfoolery.

* Overall I can see dex to be slightly more useful if i'm sitting at a desk doing stuff with a stylus, but I typically prefer tablet mode + keyboard. 

 Overall, i'm pretty damn impressed. Once you figure out how to use all the functionality, you can get plenty done with here. I'd argue this is a better laptop replacement than the ipad pro solely because you can just plug a damn mouse on to it if needed, and it has a normal file system. 

It's a very unique setup with no real direct competition (I think a huawei tablet also has a desktop mode?), that I probably wouldn't really recommend it to anyone besides samsung users that are familiar with all the power user features of samsung software these days, especially with the premium price for a platform that google pretty much abandoned.... but there is something here that is special if you put the effort, and i'm glad I picked this up instead of getting the pixel book lol. Will replace my chromebook as a vacation travel device.

2021-08-22,1629663036,PSA: Markup tool destroys your images. Photos messes up the file modification date,"Just wanted to have a little PSA that Google's Markup tool destroys your image quality.

It does not matter how much or how little you edit, the moment you save the image using the Markup tool, the quality is destroyed.

Here are some examples:

[Original image](https://i.imgur.com/cG9aRqT.jpg)

[Edited using the Markup tool](https://i.imgur.com/2QZ4b6v.png). The image is downsized, EXIF is stripped and the quality is heavily degraded.

Here's [the photo edited with Skitch](https://i.imgur.com/fIXhB9P.jpg), an awesome annotation tool that was unfortunately killed once EverNote bought it. The picture is also downsized to the same size as Markup, EXIF is stripped, but the quality is maintained.

Here's a side-by-side: [Markup vs Skitch](https://i.imgur.com/vqEqO1m.jpg)

Interestingly, marking up pictures using Google Photos does not destroy quality and does not resize the image. And it also preserves the EXIF data. But it does [mess up the modification date of the image](https://i.imgur.com/bTcZ9av.png).

*Samsung*


Samsung W2019: https://www.gizmochina.com/product/samsung-w2019/


Starting off on the high end, we have the w2019. According to digitaltrends
(https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-w2019-high-end-flip-phone-unveiled/) it costed 2.7k USD and came with stuff like a concierge service.It's successor the w2020 and onward are foldables in the style of the z fold, but more expensive. It strikes me as odd that china was a bigger market for high end flip phones than south korea.


Also something interesting, a lot of the newer W series flip phones have GSMarena articles, but no database entries
Below are the respective predecessors to the w2019

It's interesting to note that according to GSMarena (https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_golden_2_flips_through_tenaa-news-9975.php) it's called the galaxy golden 2, despite the w2014 and the galaxy golden being different devices, and it didn't seem seem to have continued with the golden naming scheme beyond the w2015.

https://www.slashgear.com/samsung-sm-g9298-is-the-flip-phone-youd-want-but-cant-have-03493858/


it's interesting to note that this is the first phone on the list available officially on amazon, at quite the pretty penny

**********************************************************************************

**********************************************************************************
Galaxy golden: https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9230_galaxy_golden-5814.php


judging by the snapdragon 400 this was likely a midrange device. This seems to be one of the models fairly widely available on online marketplace sites but i'm skeptical of their authenticity.

**********************************************************************************
Galaxy folder 2: https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_folder2-9331.php


A rather recent low~midrange device. According to korea's SK telecom website there seems to be the original and the 2021 variant but i can't tell if there's a difference beyond the color availability.


https://shop.tworld.co.kr/wireless/product/detail?categoryId=20010001&amp;productGrpId=000002173&amp;subscriptionId=NA00006534&amp;subcommDcMthd=20&amp;addServiceId=&amp;addServiceNm=&amp;selSubcommTerm=24

Also according to a Q &amp;A by a seller from a user named kuanyue90, the galaxy folder 2 on initial release didn't have 4g support, when it was coded the g1650 while the g160n has 4g support. There's also a mention of differing single sim and dual sim versions but i can't find anything that would suggest a 3rd model code existing for differing single sim/dual sim models, so it probably was a region thing.

**********************************************************************************
Galaxy folder: https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_folder-7453.php


the original galaxy folder. I've found 3 differing model numbers for the folder 1, the 150N0, the 150NL and the 1600. no idea what the exact differences are. There's also a confusingly similar called the g150s that isn't android based as far as i could tell.


g150s (non android): https://shopee.com.my/Samsung-Galaxy-Folder-Model-G150S-1-Year-Warranty-Brand-New-i.49811599.1598349663

g150n0: see top of section


g1600: https://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/samsung/galaxyfoldersmg1600/

from this ebay listing we can indeed see the box listed as galaxy folder without a 2. Interestingly, searching up g1600 pulls the gsmarena database entry but the exact model code isn't listed on the database entry. 

**********************************************************************************
*LG*


wine smart(D486/f480): https://m.gsmarena.com/lg_wine_smart-7451.php


here we go with the different model numbers again. There's the two above but online searches indicate a h410 existing as well. For some reason, the lg wine 2 is listed on the lg website but it's a proper feature phone and not a smart phone as far as i could tell, despite it's OS being named ""AOSP 8.1""


h410: https://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/lg/winesmart2015/

okay so it seems anything named smart runs full android. this is one of the many budget android flip phones that run the snapdragon 210, which persists even to android flip phones releasing in 2022.

**********************************************************************************
*Sharp*


007SH: https://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/sharp/hybrid007sh/


this one's quite the cool one. Rather than some of the phones on this list using inner and outer screens, the top portion is rotatable, which ties in to the big camera lens on this thing. Points of failure aside i wish this design had a refresh with better specs for the current market.

**********************************************************************************
SH7228u: https://www.mobosdata.com/phone/sharp-sh7228u/


This one's really sparse on information. The only confirmation that it runs full android and not a restricted android is this one forum post where the seller mentions having go launcher and being able to uninstall it. but i don't know if this means it has play store access or just apk installation permissions. This video also shows this phone's setup and it says 7x28 which might mean there's others in the lineup that run android too but i'm not certain

2018-11-06,1541520924,I tested the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS for a week - here's a detailed analysis and my choice between the two,"I posted some thoughts about the Apple iPhone XS in comparison to the Google Pixel 3 [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9tnmm6/my_take_on_the_pixel_3_vs_iphone_xs/) and wanted to write a detailed final analysis of the two phones for everyones benefit. While this is what I came away with after a week of serious testing on both devices, I think any person could come up with a different decision depending on what they want to prioritize for their money. Im happy to answer any questions for those still on the fence or curious about particular aspects of these phones performance.

Ive been an owner of both Apple and Android based products over the past 10 years and dont really have a fanboy bias towards one camp or the other.

For anyone undecided about these two phones, Id highly suggest not only following MKBHDs five pillars of a smartphone (build, performance, battery, display, camera) but also following his suggestion during a recent interview on SuperSaf TV about needing to prioritize those five for your needs and then making a decision based on that. For my needs, I rank the pillars in this order: performance, display, camera, battery, build. 

**PERFORMANCE**

iOS and Android are best represented by these two phones. iOS with gestures is a very immersive experience. Although the lifeless grid of app icons still hasnt changed, the experience on iOS is more practical and polished. Animations are fluid and the A12 bionic chip doesnt break a sweat even with intense app switching and graphic processing. 

For me, Android is all about personalized minimalism. Although Samsung and One Plus allow more unusual customizations, I find that stock Android is true simplicity. The gestures  in Android Pie are a welcome change but I have to say they feel unfinished. The way in which one has to double swipe up from the bottom to get the app drawer to open (or one long swipe if you have a big thumb) needs improvement like many other details in the operating system. They say an update is coming but if you care about raw power, the RAM management issues clearly lead to apps needing to refresh before opening. Even a week in, Ive seen some random stalls already in some typical apps. 

Apples iOS is noticeably more complete - albeit a bit boring. Android Pie has great possibilities but it just isnt a finished product at this moment and I dont have an interest in being a test subject while Google puts their finishing touches on the user experience.

**DISPLAY**

Both phones have great quality displays. The entire iPhone is maybe 1-2mm shorter than the Pixel 3 but it has a much larger and substantial display. The Pixel screen has vivid colors and doesnt leave much to be desired - however, in low light, there is a black crush issue. I noticed blacks lagging to respond as they are turned off, which leads to the impression of black spots smudging as you scroll. This doesnt happen on the iPhone panel at similar brightness levels. Also, I noticed a number of times that the extreme corners of the Pixels screen are not always accurate and responsive to finger inputs in comparison to the iPhones at similar points in the display.

Both are solid but the iPhone exploits the total dimensions of the phones footprint for a huge screen (yes, even with a notch that I never even think about) that makes viewing media and text easier on the eyes.

**CAMERA**

I tested the hell out of these two cameras to the point my friends thought I was crazy. I didnt trust the YouTube videos and needed to see results for myself in the world I see from day to day.

Apple has made some serious progress over the last couple of years in the photography department and I think theres a reason why every YouTube tech reviewer is comparing these two flagship cameras. First thing is first - for still photography, the Pixel is far more successful than the iPhone. However, with some extra shooting and some post-shooting editing, the iPhone is extremely competitive and sometimes even beats out the Pixel. 

There is one really important thing that you have to consider if youre choosing between both phones - if youre primarily using your phone to share photos to social media, where sizes tend to be smaller and where photos are primarily viewed on mobile phone displays, then the difference is relatively negligible between the two cameras, especially if you do any detailed editing. I spent some time editing XS photos to mimic Pixel and frankly, it just isnt that hard to get close to a similar image composition. On the other hand, if you open up an image on a computer and zoom in to check details, youll definitely see the minor and sometimes major flaws in iPhones photos.

I have found that Pixel typically sacrifices color and light accuracy in exchange for sharpness and dramatic composition. Its pretty clear that Google uses computational processing to create images that use striking contrast to produce an almost 3D effect in how it layers shadows and colors. A side effect is that sometimes sunsets will be strangely subdued (while they should be vivid with color) or skin will seem abnormally textured (something a real camera typically doesnt do). In contrast, iPhone aims for more realistic color but flattens out and heavily evens out images. Shadows on the iPhone tend to be reduced and in low light, there is usually a ton of noise and loss of data, especially on the selfie shooter. 

If video and audio recording is of serious importance to your decision, stop reading this and get the iPhone. The iPhone XS has a great microphone and rich 4K video with many shooting configurations. Pixel has better stabilization but it comes at a price - Google crops the image down so that it can work with the outer edge of the images in order to beautifully dial in stabilization but it loses visual definition in the process. Also without the computational photography, the video on the pixel seems like it comes from a sub $500 budget handset instead of a $800+ flagship. 

Pixel takes it for photos (if you want something ready to go on social media without editing) but iPhone is almost neck and neck with a little help from editing. For Video and audio, iPhone is leading the industry.

**BATTERY**

There is no comparison between these two batteries. iPhones standby time is absurd (losing 2% in 8 hours in my testing). I can fully charge the battery, use the phone staring first thing in the morning with a heavy dose of YouTube videos, Redditing, emails, phone calls, facetime calls, and still have 15-20% right before I go to sleep. With the Pixel, as you approach the late afternoon into evening, youll be dipping into the mid 30s with several hours to go before the end of the day. I think most heavy users will need to top off the Pixel to last through an entire day.

iPhone outshines the Pixel with battery endurance but I should point out that the Pixel has far better fast charging than the iPhone. Also, screw Apple for not including a proper fast charger in the box! (Pro tip: get at 12W charger instead of the official fast charger for the XS. Its virtually the same and costs less)

**BUILD**

Both phones are really well built. iPhone is over the top with its thick glass, stainless steel, and overall weight. I find the XS to be slightly too heavy for extended one handed use and also continually fear about dropping it. The pixel is so beautifully designed for the hand. Its light, feels durable, and in general it is reminiscent of the Galaxy S8 but without the screen melting off the sides. Both have stereo speakers with solid volume. Pixel has some obvious bass vibration in the body of the phone. iPhone has beautifully tuned dual speakers and they generally sound better equalized and detailed in comparison to the pixel. 

While Id like to call it a tie, i think the implementation of the larger display and speaker quality gives it to the iPhone. 

One side note: I noticed audio is generally better on the iPhone in comparison to the Pixel. /u/AmirZ pointed out this important piece of information in my last post and I wanted to pass it along here:
&gt;Android unfortunately upsamples from 44.1kHz to 48kHz by default, which can reduce the audio quality if your source doesn't support Direct PCM passthrough or Compressed Offload (if the music player doesn't decode to WAV). iPhone on the other hand is much smarter and uses the proper output sampling rate from what I've heard. So that might contribute to the worse quality. Also, the new Pixel dongle has a terrible AMP with only 0.4V output, compared to the 0.7V+ that is standard across other phones.

**CONCLUSION**

As you can see, the iPhone took 3 of the 5 categories or pillars without much of a fight. As I seriously contemplated this decision, I was desperately holding on to two things from Android - an industry leading still photography camera and a stock operating system - against everything that Apple offers at $300 more. This is where you need to decide what youre willing to sacrifice. Ultimately, the loss of video recording with quality audio is a deal breaker for what I want from a phone. 

If point and shoot photography and Google services and/or customization is your priority, Pixel is a no brainer. Its cheaper than Apple, takes ready to publish photos 8 out of 10 times (Id call iPhones photos strong 5 out of 10 times) and the smaller Pixel 3 feels absolutely amazing in the hand. Its snappy and will be at the front of the line in the Android world for updates for at least the next two years.

But If you want a high power flagship that every competitor will try to knock down, the iPhone XS, like Samsungs Note 9, gives you everything that you would realistically need. Ill be first to admit that its less exciting to use than Android, but the elegance and reliability of the experience in combination with industry leading video &amp; audio, makes it the phone for me for the next few years.

**TL:DR:** The iPhone XS overtakes the Pixel 3 in a number of areas this year. Apple is more competitive in computational photography (look at the insane amount of camera comparisons on YouTube) than I would have expected. Google dropped the ball on a few things that matter to me when they're charging a premium price, so Ill spend a little more cash and get something that every competitor will be measuring itself against.

2021-01-15,1610741828,Thoughts on Android tablets after my experience with the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite,"Just in case you were about to buy an Android tablet... hear me out. (tl;dr at the end) 

Also I should mention for the record, prices are in USD. 

Right, so I should probably start off by saying that I really wanted to love my Tab S6 Lite. I wanted to tell myself that it was ""good enough"" for what I was using it for. But after a few frustrating and disappointing months, I eventually came to the conclusion that there are too many fundamental flaws with the experience, and I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. The amount of missteps and cost-cuts they made when putting this together, and the amount of issues compared to my old iPad mini 4 that was $499 in 2015, is honestly baffling to me.

That being said, I think that Android tablets certainly have their place with sub-$100 devices from the likes of Amazon, meant for people who can't afford (or don't want to spend more on) the more premium devices, or for children who will easily break them. But I believe that these premium tablets that are being pushed as iPad-killers (mostly from Samsung) are just too flawed to be viable. Don't be fooled by the impressive low prices of things like the Tab S6 Lite or the Tab S7, with their nice designs and included s-pen. It's just simply not worth it. 

The following is a general list of reasons why I believe iPadOS is currently better for tablets than Android. (note: This applies to even comparing a $329 iPad to an $849 Tab S7+) 

"" Better optimization for large screens in apps, especially in landscape mode (Twitter, Discord, and Firefox are all good examples of popular apps that are better on iPad, also the wasted space vs the iPad in apps like the Play Store and Facebook)  
"" Able to sync with Signal messaging app  
"" Exclusive creative/work apps (LumaFusion, iMovie, Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, Procreate, Photoshop, Flip, Logic Remote, GarageBand, various note taking apps)  
"" Multi-finger gestures (4 finger swipe up and hold for multitasking, 4 finger swipe up to go home, 5 finger pinch for multitasking, you might not find them useful, but especially those 4 finger gestures are very natural and fluid because of how similar they are to swiping up from the bottom)  
"" Longer and more consistent software and security updates (and just in case this point or its importance hasn't clicked for you yet, here's a wake up call: the Tab S5e came out in 2019, and to my knowledge it isn't getting One UI 3.0 for another 6 months even though it's been out of beta for a few weeks, while the iPad Air 2 that came out in 2014 is on the latest version of iPadOS 14)  
"" Stock keyboard is a better keyboard than anything on Android for tablets, due to the spacing afforded by the aspect ratio (imho)  
"" Aspect ratio is also better for using apps and browsing the internet (it's generally worse for watching videos due to letterboxing, but the importance of that is debatable)  
"" The likelihood of future apps getting full-on iPad support that don't have it yet (i.e. Apollo for Reddit) seems to be much higher than apps like Twitter and Discord getting more optimized apps on Android* 

The following is a list of gripes I have with the Tab S6 Lite; these may not apply to all Android tablets. 

"" Unreliable and insecure biometric authentication compared to any iPad, or most other Android tablets for that matter (it's only facial recognition with the camera, so it doesn't work in the dark, it's not very secure, and even in ideal conditions it only works about 70% of the time, and you need to put in your pattern/pin every 24 hours for security reasons)  
"" Awful blue light filter (instead of changing color temperature, it just applies a translucent yellow over the entire display, so for example black changes to dark yellow, and also it can't even be scheduled& ??????)  
"" Significantly worse glare compared to newer iPads that have the anti-glare coating (from what I've seen this also applies to other Android tablets like the Tab S7)  
"" Display isn't very good (it's LCD which is fine, but it's a TFT panel instead of IPS, which means it has really bad viewing angles and the colors are muted, I didn't think this would bother me but it's surprisingly sub-par even for the price imo)  
"" Touch response is not very good (i.e. it feels 'jello-y' and lags behind the finger a bit more than something like a $329 iPad)  
"" There are occasional stutters and pauses that tend to bog down the experience (even my mom's iPad Air 2 has less frequent stutters and a more responsive touch screen)  
"" Multitasking is kind of pitiful (can only really hold 3 apps in RAM at one time, again I didn't think it would bother me but combined with the mediocre load times it can get irritating)  
"" UI is noticeably lacking smoothness/responsiveness (i.e. going in and out of multitasking, going home, quick settings, opening an app, setting up split view)  
"" For some reason I'm not allowed to use synced calls and texts with my (Samsung) phone (probably because of Verizon not allowing it to work or something, but still that is really stupid that this advertised feature straight up doesn't work)  
"" Side note: if you were hoping to heavily customize a Samsung tablet, it doesn't come with the galaxy themes store and sideloading an apk of it doesn't work, so you can't use something like hex installer to customize it... bummer 

Of course there is a list of reasons why these premium Android tablets are better (DeX on some models, micro SD card support on some models, launcher and icon customization, emulators that are easy to install and work pretty well, FoRtNiTe, third party app stores like F-Droid [and some other apps and stores for dirty people who hate spending money], also pricing outside of the US is different I get that) but to me personally, these are vastly outweighed by the fundamental improvements to the tablet experience that iPadOS has by design. 

Sooo& yeah. Probably going to switch back to an iPad once I get a chance. Really unfortunate as I was hoping that this tablet would integrate better with my phone, but oh well. 

*side note: This last point may be purely speculation, however Signal is already syncing with iPads but not Android tablets, Apollo dev has confirmed that an iPad version is in the works, and we have no word on any of the problematic apps that I've mentioned getting improvements on Android (except for Signal but who knows how long that will take)


tl;dr: iPads are better than Android tablets in pretty much every single way these days. Cheap Android tablets are fine for the price and all, but if you're looking for anything over $300 you should probably be looking at an iPad.",Android,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ky2ubi/thoughts_on_android_tablets_after_my_experience/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_ios,,,,,,,,
2022-04-26,1651001047,"My thoughts on Galaxy S21 vs Zenfone 8, and a discussion on compact phones","## **TLDR:** 

S21 better than Zenfone 8. I also would like manufacturers to TRY releasing a smaller midrange phone and can't understand why they don't do it (other than """"low demand"""") 

## **Intro**

I've always been an advocate for more compact phones, especially nowadays where every Android released is over 6.5 inches.

No, I don't have tiny hands, I don't need to keep my phone in my purse, or have an issue with pocket sizes.

I just want a more ergonomic, nicer feeling phone, and to be able to use it one-handed without doing the awkward ""shuffle""

Why can't huge manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi fit in a more compact phone in the incredibly bloated lineups they come up with every year? **I'd love to see some discussion on this.** 

Is it due to complexity of the internal components in a smaller form factor? 
Market research and data says ""fk ur small phones""?
More synergy and savings to have more common parts in their manufacturing processes? 
Is it the Illuminati?

WHY ARE THERE NO COMPACT MIDRANGERS?

*(Samsung if you're reading this, please please please make a smaller Galaxy A52s at like $300-350 and I'll buy it instantly. You can even name it the A42s.)*

## **Context and history**

The only available ""compact"" options worth considering for me are the Zenfone 8, S21 and S22 (I live in Brazil)

I use the word ""compact"" lightly because people get pissy about that (for true compact you pretty much have to go iPhone 12/13 mini).

Here's a [PhoneArena comparison](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size/Samsung-Galaxy-S21,Asus-ZenFone-8,Xiaomi-12X/phones/11508,11727,11889) for phones I'd consider ""compact"" (S21, ZF8, Xiaomi 12X)

I am a fairly light user, and before these phones being compared below, I was using a Galaxy S10e - I still love and miss the phone but I was getting an abysmal 2-3 hours of SoT, due to almost 3 years of use, and.. Exynos I guess. The screen also started crapping out (due to long term water damage I think?)

Prior to the S10e, I used the S7, and the Xperia Z3 Compact before that (see the trend?) 

I usually switch phones every 2 to 3 generations and I almost always buy the previous year's flagships to get more value out of my money (hence S22 = no buy)

Anyways, I needed to move on.

## **Comparing the S21 and the Zenfone 8**

After looking and shopping around, I was lucky to own both the Samsung Galaxy S21 and the Asus Zenfone 8 along the last 5 months (albeit not simultaneously for very long), allowing me to give my honest thoughts and comparison between the two. 

PS: I paid very similar prices for both phones.

I won't bother reading out the entire spec sheet (here's a [handy link](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Samsung-Galaxy-S21,Asus-ZenFone-8/phones/11508,11727) for that), but regarding sizes:

The S21 has a 6.2 inch, 120Hz panel with 424 PPI and a 86% screen-to-body ratio, with these dimensions: 
5.97 x 2.80 x 0.31 inches (151.7 x 71.2 x 7.9 mm)

The Zenfone 8 has a 5.9 inch, 120Hz panel with 446 PPI and a 83% screen-to-body ratio, with these dimensions: 
5.83 x 2.70 x 0.35 inches (148 x 68.6 x 8.9 mm)

## Ergonomics &amp; usability: **S21 wins**

Even though they have similar dimensions, the Zenfone 8 is a little thicker and that made it feel more chunky in the hand, especially with a case. 

I don't mind the S21 being slightly taller and wider. Vertical size isn't as big of an issue for me, since I use Nova Launcher to swipe down notifications from the middle of the screen.

## Design: **S21 wins**

I like the S21's border camera module, while the ZF8 just looks too bland. Plus, the ZF8's camera module is not equidistant on the the side and top, which bothers me.

On the front, S21 has smaller and symmetrical bezels, while the ZF8 has the silver ring around the selfie cam, which is distracting to me and cheapens the look. The ZF8's speaker grill is also larger and more prone to getting dirt stuck inside.

## Build: **ZF8 wins**

The frosted glass back and the borders definitely feel more premium compared to the S21. I actually like the plastic back on the S21 for durability, but the ZF8 just feels nicer and colder to the touch. 

However, since I always use a case, none of this matters, so this win barely counts for me.

## Screen: **S21 wins**

Slightly more real estate on the S21, no silver ring around selfie cam, and the adaptive refresh rate is a plus.
Still a great panel on the ZF8 though.

## Fingerprint sensor: **S21 wins**

This deserves its own category just because of how badly the S21 wins here.

The ultrasonic sensor on the S21 is much much faster and more reliable.
ZF8 has to annoyingly light up the sensor region, has a lower success rate, and it becomes completely GARBAGE if you use a glass screen protector.

The glass screen protector thing on the ZF8 pissed me off immensely. I had to press down hard and for a long time to use it and even then it only worked 60% of the time.
I tried re-registering them to fix it but it was hopeless. Not sure if it's fixable with software updates.

## Sound: **ZF8 wins**

Not a huge audio guy and I've moved on from wanting a headphone jack, but this is a win for the ZF8. 

Has headphone jack, speakers on the ZF8 seem a bit louder with comparable quality. [GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/best_phone_speakers_of_2021-news-52157.php) rates it higher than the S21 (I think? Idk what LUFS means)

## Camera: **tie?**

Both capable and snappy cameras that will give you good shots.

Since I didn't own both phones at the same time for very long, it's hard for me to give a proper comparison or claim a winner, although I'm sure you can find some on Youtube. Overall I was satisfied with both (I mostly use them for pictures of my cats).

Night mode shots on the S21 felt more consistent, but I believe the Zenfone 8 has better GCam support, so this could compensate.

However, selfies on the S21 still feel like they have a ""beautify"" filter on them. Maybe it's placebo from being a long time Samsung user.

S21 has an extra telephoto camera over the ZF8 but I'll only ever use the main and ultrawide so it's whatever.

## OS: **S21 wins**

Zen UI is very stock feeling with some nice features, and I didn't mind it. However I've really grown to enjoy One UI, especially with functionalities from Good Lock etc. I also prefer Samsung Pay to Google Pay.

Samsung also has DeX which is nice but I don't really have an use case for it.

I'm confident the S21 will receive updates and security patches faster (and probably for longer too) than the ZF8

## Battery: **tie/slight ZF8 win?**

Being smaller flagship phones, you can't expect much from these guys. The 4000 mAh battery on both these phones will give you 5-6 hours of SoT and I can live with that. You could maybe stretch it with changing power saving modes and screen refresh rate but not worth it for me.

I don't have the numbers to back this up, but it did feel like the ZF8 lasted a bit longer, maybe 5%, not a huge deal.

ZF8 has a 30W charger in the box which is a nice win over the S21.
S21 has wireless and reverse wireless charging over the ZF8 (doesn't really matter to me)

## SoC and stuff: **tie?**

I'm not the best person to compare these things cause I'm a ""casual"" user. I just use reddit, video content consumption, camera and mostly banking/food delivery/transport apps.

At most I'll play some Stardew Valley on my phone. I don't edit videos, I don't use the GPU for anything else and don't really care for benchmark scores. As long as the phone feels fast and snappy, I'm happy.

With that said, The ZF8 comes with the Snapdragon 888, while my region gets the Exynos 2100 version of the S21. Both phones felt great to use and were completely fine. No noticeable overheating or performance issues on either.

I haven't kept up with the *eXyNos BaD!1!* meme, but I have absolutely no complaints. Plus, in this Android Addicts' recent [battery comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jkgBQ-bGEY), the Exynos 2100 actually **beat** the Snap 888 by a fairly decent margin.

S21 has 8GB of RAM over ZF8's 6GB, but I couldn't care less here.

Both have 128GB of non-expandable storage which is meh but liveable. IMO 256GB needs to be the new baseline for flagship phones.

So I guess it's a tie for me.

## **Final thoughts:**

Final tally:

**Samsung Galaxy S21** - 5W/2L/3D

Asus Zenfone 8 - 2W/5L/3D

Overall, these are phones with similarities but in the end it will come down to preference in the details I mentioned in my comparison.

None has a huge advantage over the other in any category except for the fingerprint sensor.

To me, the S21 was clearly superior due to feel in the hand, software, and of course, the fingerprint sensor.

In the end, I kept the S21 and sold the Zenfone 8 (with a very small loss luckily), and I'm happy with my decision.

## **Honorable mentions:**

**Galaxy S22** -- I'm glad Samsung went even smaller with the S22, but I'm not paying the release prices and no I don't care for the bundled Galaxy Buds and Watches. If they keep the size, maybe I'll cop the S23 in 2024.

**Xiaomi 12/12X** -- very new releases at great sizes and seem to offer decent value, but availability and warranty are big concerns for me. Would love to see Xiaomi and other chinese manufacturers offer more stuff like this.

**Pixel 4a/5a** -- a bit bigger than the phones mentioned here but still compact-ish. I would consider them but unfortunately I don't live in one of the, like, 3 countries where Google sells them :\^)

2013-04-30,1367280400,Why are Google's apps consistently better-looking on iOS than they are on Android?,"Google Now just got released on iOS, and I've been playing with it on my iPod, and the interface is significantly nicer than it is on Android. Not only is it way more responsive on iOS than it's ever been on any Android device I've touched, it's got a much better interface combining the ""Google Search"" with the Now cards. Even small little nuances like swiping a card away has a better animation in the iOS app than it does on Android.

Same with Gmail. It looks leaps and bounds better in iOS than it does on Android. Same with Drive, Google+, and even YouTube looks more polished. 

I'm not sure if this is a matter of Holo vs iOS's interface and creative differences between them, but it definitely feels like there's a significant lack of polish in the Android versions of Google apps, aside from the layout differences. The iOS versions tend to have better animations and visuals across the board.

Is anyone else annoyed by this? You'd think that Google would put more effort into their Android apps than iOS, especially considering that Android has a larger market share than iOS right now, and since it's their own platform. 


**EDIT:** A bunch of people asked for screenshot comparisons. I took a few from some Google Apps. I've blocked out my personal information from them, but you can definitely see a difference in the level of polish in each version of the app.

Ill just list what's better on iOS and what android should borrow from it imho.

And overall the things i miss lol

What android should have : 

-real cloud backup like icloud :all apps, their data , files , settings , and the ability to disable/enable backup for certain apps 

-tap  the status bar to perform a ""home"" -going to the top of the page- (maybe is it possible for third party devs to implement that) 

-automatic app filtering in app drawer,using app flags 

-ability to change language on a per app basis . You can do it on Android already, but only for a few selected apps, while it's available in nearly every iOS app 

-better SDKs and APIs , more concistent . iOS apps are really something , beautiful and powerful

-android's own language , like iOS ? Maybe fuschia in the future ? For better perfs 

-better use of devices hw...but sadly this probably won't come given the amount of devices that need to be supported ...

Like look at the amount of amazing iOS apps that make use of lidar sensor , while TOF sensor was useless on Android , to my great disappointment

2015-01-17,1421509097,Reddit Apps on Android and iOS,"Recently I've been using an iPad as I received one for free with my university course, so I thought I'd try out the reddit app I see mentioned most: Alien Blue. 

I'd always been told that iOS got the best quality apps, so I was eager to see how it compared to Android in the reddit field, especially after Alien Blue became an official reddit app recently. 

I have to say, I'm not impressed. I've been using Reddit Sync Pro for years, and thoroughly enjoyed it on both phone and tablet, though I always thought it worked somewhat better on my phone than my tablet (Nexus 4, 5 and 6 vs Nexus 10). So Reddit Sync is primarily what I'm comparing against, though I have used others before, such as Reddit is Fun, Reddit News and Bacon reader. 

I have just been thoroughly disappointed with Alien Blue from the beginning, firstly the design is not to my taste, the plasticky wooden background looks very ugly to me compared with the design of any of the Android apps mentioned. I thought iOS design was moving away from the ""fake material"" type backgrounds, but apparently the Alien Blue dev didn't get this memo. 

Secondly, the list of subreddits seems to only show around 50% of my subscriptions so if I want to visit a specific subreddit half the time I have to manually input it. The option for this is right at the bottom of the list of subreddits for some reason, meaning I have to scroll past them all to access it, which seems like a terrible design choice to me. 

Thirdly, the in app browser seems to barely work with 90% of the content posted on reddit and will try to just show me the header for the website or some other irrelevant part. Don't get me started on an article with pictures in, when it manages to display the text correctly, it's then completely unable to display pictures. I can choose to open in safari, but I use chrome. Though I think this is a limitation of iOS and not the app. 

There's just a lot of things like this, most of them are smaller gripes than this and don't need listing, but there's often a lot of redundancy in the app with several ways to do the same action displayed on a page unnecessarily. 

Maybe I just expected more from ""the best reddit app"" but I've been pretty disappointed. I choose not to browse reddit on my iPad anymore as the experience is just better on my phone. 

Anyone else feel the same way or seen other apps where the user experience just isn't as good as on Android? ",Android,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2sqm83/reddit_apps_on_android_and_ios/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2020-06-30,1593488053,"I'm not tired of Android, but I'm tired of Google neglecting Android","After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.

To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):

    - HTC Evo 4G
    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)
    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)
    - HTC Evo 3D
    - Google Nexus S
    - Google Galaxy Nexus
    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)
    - Samsung Galaxy S4
    - HTC One X (briefly)
    - Motorola Moto X (original)
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4
    - Google Nexus 6
    - Motorola Moto X 2015
    - Google Nexus 6P
    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)
    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)
    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)
    
About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM/YTM/YT Premium, etc.  

---------------------------------

The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.

I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. 

- One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from ""YouTube Music"".

- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.

---------------------------------

But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. 

Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:

- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps

- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship ""killers"", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support

- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add ""powered by Android"" on their bootscreens](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy

- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features

- **Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because ""Android 10.1"" is being released as ""Android 11"". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)

- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone

- **Google is still a ""faceless"" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as ""being used in a way that violates Google's policies"" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has ""done so."" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time

- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located

- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)

- Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriers

So I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very ""self-service""/""you're on your own"". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is /r/Android, and Android is supposed to be a ""platter"" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).

Does anyone else feel similar?

2023-09-18,1695062337,My uninspired and frankly boring take on iPhone vs Android,"I've been an avid user of iPhones for some 15 years, but lately, with iPhone 12 (Mini and non-Mini), I've decided to give Android a try due to being tired of:

a) Siri's shitty performance,   
b) Face ID regularly demanding a PIN for some unexplained reason since update 40294230320349234 (newly introduced security script, apparently),   
c) Apple Wallet regularly demanding a PIN for some explained reason (stupid security script)  
d) the design of the device being underwhelming, actually looking uglier and cheaper than, say, iPhone 8, 6 or 5s (the 5 was a true gem!)   
e) non-existent PC connectivity for messaging (although this has apparently changed now with Windows Phone Link), which was a huge thing. And no, I'm not going with a Mac.

So, I decided to sell my few months old iPhone 12 and get a comparable Android. After doing research, the final choice was for a second-hand but mint Samsung S21FE (which was cheaper than what I got for my significantly scratched iPhone 12...), which I generally enjoy very much. It:

a) is actually better looking design-wise IMHO, the material doesn't really feel inferior  
b) has a gorgeous display with 120 Hz (this is a bigger thing than I expected it to be) and the nominally lower PPI isn't even showing for some reason; it looks just as crisp, even though I am very sensitive to resolutions  
c) has a better OS  the Android system is just simply better with stuff like procedures *^((automated connecting to my BT set in response to launching the YouTube Music app - I'd never been able to achieve that with iOS))* and customizability *^((I have an app that allows me to turn on the flashlight by holding the power button  how cool is that))**.* Also, the return button makes a major difference for comfortable navigating.

But there's one thing: the damn phone unlocking in Android. I just can't get it right, no matter what. The fingerprint reader sucks, the wannabe face recognition sucks, pattern lock is basically the only usable thing, but I'm not a troglodyte to be using tech solutions from 2010. Also, and this is especially disappointing: Smart Lock sucks as well, because it doesn't work in 30% of cases, for some bloody reason. Against all this mess, Apple FaceID seems a godsend.

So, long story short  if some Chinese manage to steal FaceID from Apple, get away with it and manage to market it in Europe one way or another, I'm set. Apple can frankly go bankrupt for all I care.

2017-11-22,1511392558,"iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, Note 8...a poor man's review","I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  

X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...

The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. 
What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.

FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. 

However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.

Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...

Being on AT&amp;T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the ""I hate Samsung"" train that is r/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying ""it's sooo smooth!""  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.

The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   

Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious ""Pure Android"" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. 

A noteworthy experience, but can it last?

My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g6i6m6m6i6c6k6 feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. 

Picasso once said ""Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun."" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but ""THE"" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, ""Smooth now, but give it a month or two..."" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. 

What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. 

Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...its 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! Im sorry for yelling, Samsung...please dont kill off the headphone jack. 

Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased/subsidized through AT&amp;T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

2018-09-27,1538010664,Forever Android user trying out IPhone XS Max,"I'm an android fanboy for the most part. I have always owned an android phone (since the droid 1). The device i switched from was a Pixel 2 XL , so most of my comparisons will be against that. I decided to give Iphone a try since i personally never have (i didn't switch because i dislike android, i still love android, but wanted to try something different). I did a similar post on /r/apple, and wanted to share my thoughts here as well (a little more detailed since i have more time to play around)

Here are some thoughts:

The Good:

**Apps**: App optimization on iOS is fantastic. The apps feel smoother, and have a much more consistent design language. Menu locations and navigation make sense, and everything is reflective of the OS as a whole. This was definitely the biggest plus moving from android.

**Hardware**: This phone *feels* like it's a thousand bucks. The heft, the feel in hand, the steel feels amazing when holding it. The display is fantastic. Up there (if not better) than the samsung counterparts. Speakers are also loud and fantastic (although the pixel 2xl is quite good too).

EDIT: Jesus fuck people, i know that these phones have the samsung panel (albeit for the XS they announced some of their stock will be from LG), but their calibrations are certainly different. I personally am more pleased with the iphone XS display than the galaxy s9. I haven't seen the note 9 in person so can't comment on that.

**Gestures**: I'm still getting used to them, but gestures are great so far on iOS. Everything feels quick and smooth, and a lot of them are common sense. I tried the android gestures out on my pixel and it just didn't feel nearly as natural. 

The Meh:

**FaceID**: I honestly don't get it. People keep telling me it's fast and just as convenient as a fingerprint sensor, but to me they're just flat out wrong. After having used it for a couple days (reset it at one point), it's just not as fast as i want it to be. I'm not an average person, so the split second that i have to wait for faceid to work frustrates the hell out of me, especially since on my pixel i would unlock the phone *as* i pulled it out of my pocket so it was ready to be looked at. Also, faceid in the dark (particularly when i wake up and want to check my notifications) is super hit or miss for me. 

**Camera**: Okay, let me start by saying that i am NOT a camera guy. I don't know what makes a camera good, other then my own opinion of how a picture comes out. With taht said, the camera on this phone is great. Probably one of the best, but to me it lags behind my Pixel 2 XL (which i think is still the best smartphone camera). The pictures feel a bit more washed out and the detail isn't there like on my 2 XL (although the 2 XL sometimes oversaturates and makes things a bit more colorful than they actually are). THe camera is excellent for what it is, but i was expecting more given the year separation between it and the pixel 2.  I will say though that portrait mode is greatt on this and definitely better than the pixel (although tbh i barely use portrait so it doesn't make a huge difference to me)

The Bad:

**Notifications**: Notifications on apple have certainly gotten better, but they still don't come close to android imo. Android is built around notifications, so i rely on them *heavily*, so apple being a step below android when it comes to this is a bit of a tough pill to swallow for me. I dislike the little info i can see of the notification when i tap my phone (vs the level of detail android provides depending on the app). I also miss being able to swipe notifications (i dislike having to press a button personally/ swiping twice). 

**Back Button**: I NEVER thought i'd miss the android back button. It's inconsitent across apps, and sometimes doesn't work the way you want it to. Even with that, it's still way easier and intuitive than the swipe back on ios (or pressing the top left back button). THe swipe sometimes takes 2 or 3 times to get right, and the top left back button is just way too far away to use consistently. 

~~**Volume**: I learned the hardway that the system volume on the IPhone is ALSO the volume for the alarm. I was used to having separate volume on android (media, phone, alarm, ring). I ALWAYS kept alarm at the highest volume while i messed around with the others to my liking depending on the situation. I missed my alarm the first 2 mornings i had the iphone, and even now i can't get the settings to my liking like i did on android.~~

EDIT: I decided to remove this is a negative because a ton of people have responded with tips on how to get around this. I went ahead and tried it out and it gave me the desired effect. I still prefer the android customization to volume, but since this fix gave me what i wanted i figured i should remove it from negatives.

**No Fingerprint Sensor**:  EVen if faceid was perfect, i'd still miss the fingerprint sensor. The swipe down for notifications, the fact that the fingerprint sensor OPENS the phone rather then just unlocks it are features thoroughly missed.

Overall, i miss android. Other then app optimization/design on iOS, i think android is superior in every way. The only reason i wanted to switch is becasue i really enjoy the apple ecosystem (i have a macbook and an ipad pro and probably plan to get a series 4 watch if i stick with the iphone). I'm going to give it another week before fully deciding if i want to keep it, but so far im not super impressed. Also, even though i already said this, it needs to be said again, the Pixel 2 XL camera is fucking god tier.

2017-04-17,1492417520,"I can't decide which OS I like better, Android or iOS.","So I've been a long time iPhone user, ever since the iPhone 3G came out. The iPhone 3G was my very first smartphone back when I was a Freshman in High School. I've owned nearly all iPhone models except for the 5. I guess you could say I'm pretty invested into the Apple ecosystem. I switched to Android when the 5 came out, and I really enjoyed it. I had an LG Optimus phone, and it was great. There were several things I really liked about android, but there were several things I've missed about iOS that I really liked. I than decided to switch back to the iPhone again. After I switched back I kinda regretted it and got another android, yet somehow I still end up back to the iPhone. 

For the past few years I've been switching back and forth between Android and IOS trying to figure out which one I like best. I Honestly like both OS's. I've used a few LG phones, the Galaxy S6, and S7. I've also used the OnePlus One. Honestly though, if it wasn't for Apple I would be a big Samsung fan. I like Apple, but Samsung would be my second choice of phones. 

**For the iPhone here are the things I really like about iOS.**

-I like the cross platforms between Mac, iPhone, iPad and the Apple TV. I own an iMac and iPad, so the AirDrop is a really nice feature. iCloud Drive is great for productivity.

-I also like iMessage, FaceTime, and some of the Apple apps such as mail, news, and the numbers spreadsheet app. iMovie is also another great app I've used for video editing. 

-I like how Apple apps are high quality and there is no lag or stutter when using iOS. 

-I also like the duel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus. I find it useful at times.

-It's pretty consistent and clean looking.

-iOS has a much better, more accurate keyboard in my opinion. 


**Here are the things I don't like about iOS** 

-Sometimes it feels kinda boring at times, I feel as if I am caged. 

-I can't really customize it to my liking, sure I can change the wallpaper and icons around, but I feel as if the iPhone is missing that 'Wow!' factor.

-I also don't like the hardware. I know it sounds dumb and petty, but with the new Galaxy S8 that just came out, putting my iPhone next to a Galaxy S8, my iPhone looks and feels ancient compared to the new S8. The Galaxy S8 looks very visually appealing. The iPhone 5s was the best looking iPhone, but the 6 and 7 just don't look very visually appealing to me. 

-Samsung just has much better specs and better hardware. I feel as if Apple is falling behind its competitors.

-I have honestly never used ForceTouch. It's completely useless to me.

-I don't like Siri. Google Now works so much better for me and actually understands my voice better. I don't really use Siri much unless I'm trying to figure out what song is playing or I'm driving. 

-Constantly updating it, I like when they add new things, but after a few versions it slows down your device. I don't want to have to worry about updating it all the time. 



**For Android, here are the things I love.**

-I really enjoy the extra customization, the themes, launchers.

-Being able to download cracked apps from the internet and using extra features for free is a big plus for me.

-I like being able to download my music for free. With iOS I usually stream my music from Spotify, but it would be nice to be able to save that extra $10 a month.

-I like how Android feels a lot more free and open. 

-The Galaxy S8 has much better and more visually appealing hardware 

-better specs vs better optimization. I can't decide on this factor.

-The S8 has an Iris scanner which is pretty fucking awesome! 
 
-I loved how Android feels more like a personalized home computer in my pocket, it feels more open. 

-Samsung Pay is far superior to Apple Pay. 

-Better notifications and a better notification drop down menu. 

-I like the back button.

-I also really liked the personalized widgets. 

-I like being able to text people on Facebook Messenger without having to close out of the app I'm in. Sure Apple has that drop down reply, but you can't see the whole text conversation. I like the chat bubble feature Android has. 

-Pretty much everything I can do on a jailbroken iPhone, I can do on Android out of the box without having to worry about updates. 



**And the things I don't like about Android.**

-Sometimes it can look and feel a bit clunky. But I also feel like its gotten a lot better with the new Grace UI on the Galaxy S8.

-It's not as smooth and fluid as iOS. 

-The apps aren't as good of quality like on the iPhone. I've noticed this a lot when using Snapchat and kik on my S7 Edge. 

-I had the Galaxy S6 and S7 and after about 3 or 4 months, it started lagging A LOT. (I'm not sure if it was an app I had downloaded that was messing up my phone, but it was really bad)

-I feel like its not as secure as the iPhone is. I think I got some bad app that messed up my Galaxy S7 which made it lag, but I'm not entirely sure if that was the case or not. 

-No iMessage




So far the thing thats keeping me from switching is AirDrop, iMessage, email app, and iCloud Drive. I'm also afraid if I get the Galaxy S8 it might lag again like my S7 did after a few months. I really like the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, but I've been watching some YouTube videos, and the camera on the S8 looks AMAZING! I may just switch for that reason alone. 

Anyways, I'm thinking of switching from the iPhone 7 Plus to the new Galaxy S8 Plus. I wanna know what you guys think. Should I make the switch again? This time I'm looking for something that'll last me a while. I don't want to have to switch again for another 4-5 years. My girlfriend has had her Galaxy Note 3 for years, it just now finally gave out on her after 5 or 6 years, which is pretty good considering most phones don't last much after 3 or 4 years.

**1.** Be mature. Don't act like the 10 year old playing Xbox Live in his basement while the parent's aren't home.

**2.** Fanboys stfu. Both sides.

**3.** Be open

**4.** If you haven't even touched an iOS product or are ignorant, don't comment.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok. I owned an iPod Touch 1G. It was kick ass, the jailbreak community was incredible. Without a jailbreak, my Touch was as good as a brick. I then owned a 3G. It was good for the first year, after that, it became slower than a snail going uphill. Then the iPhone 4 was announced. I bought an iPhone 4 because Android was not established on AT&amp;T at all. No real question to get the 4 at the time. 

So here I am, with a jailbroken iPhone 4, and I love it. I honestly couldn't be happier with it. There are so many things that separate it from other phones, and those are primarily jailbroken add-ons, but also some iOS features. My two brothers both have Samsung Galaxy S Captivates. They like their phones too. They wanted to separate from the norm, and get Android. That's fine with me.

One thing I do want to note, is that I am trying here to compare a Jailbroken iOS device to a rooted Android device. I will flat out admit that a stock iOS device sucks. In the first month of having my iPhone 4, when there wasn't a jailbreak, I *hated it*. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
So please, share you opinions and comment. Tell my why you prefer Android. Tell me your favorite feature, big or small. Tell me one cool application (I don't care about games). Once I feel like the discussion is going well, I'll input my reasons why I (think I) prefer my iPhone.

EDIT: Forgot something. Please don't mention Tegra 2, dual core, graphics, or anything hardware related. We all know, Android currently has better hardware. There, already said it for you all, so you don't need to mention it in the comments! Killing birds for you. You're welcome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT numba 2: Alright, I want to list some things I like about my setup on iOS (jailbroken iPhone 4) 
* Hold the sleep button down for 2 seconds and the LED comes on.

* Hold the home button down, music plays, hold volume keys up or down, songs change. 

* Click both up and down, camera loads.

* Notifications on iPhone suck, but I use a quick reply sms app similar to Handcent SMS.

* Calendar Events, Birthdays, 7 Day weather, time, new Mail, and Class Schedule on the LockScreen (LockInfo)

* an invisible android like lock screen so no one knows how to get into my phone (AndroidLock)

* Folders definitely do help a lot, especially sorting all my games.

Now for some things generally that iOS has going for it

* App Store restrictions limit spam apps and such, but is also bad because creativity and usefulness goes down.

* An insane amount of usermade themes/tones/apps (~15-20 thousand, a lot are themes) from jailbreak 
community.

* Since iPhones are so similar in terms of hardware, all applications don't require that much updating to make it 
work for newer generations of iPhones.

* Easy Jailbreaks (which might be the same on Android after heading about z4root)

* Every phone gets every update at the same time (minus the older generations) No Samsung Galaxy S bullshit",Android,152,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ftxip/alright_randroid_lets_have_a_mature_ios_vs/,neutral,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2014-01-25,1390646313,A step by step guide about how to get started and involved in Android Development from no programming experience. With all the resources I used!,"In June last year I gave myself the goal to create an Android app by the end of the year, except with only the most basic of Visual Basic under my belt.

I've been requested several times to share how I made my app and got started, hence the post.

**Battle of the IDE's: Android Studio vs Eclipse** 

IDE stand for: Integrated Development Environment.
Wikipedia sums up what an IDE is very nicely: An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

At Google I/O last year Google released Android Studio, still in Beta, the Android Studio IDE is the upcoming replacement for the aging Eclipse IDE (Which I have never used for more than ten minutes).

[Android Studio Screenshot](http://www.infinum.co/system/uploads/2013-06/android-studio-3.png)

[Eclipse Screenshot](http://www.caffeinedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Eclipse-IDE-with-Android-Sample-Project-Snake.png) 

Having not used Eclipse extensively at all I can see the choice in which to use between the two is obvious: Android Studio - It's rock solid in terms of stability, it look and functions better AND somewhere down the line when Android Studio is the obvious choice (it's development is insane, there are updates weekly) you'll want to move to it anyway.

One of the requirements for Android Studio is the Java JDK, which can be found here:

[Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)  

Once that is installed, Install Android Studio:

[Android Studio Link](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)

No need to open it just yet.


**Java** 

Not to be confused with Javascript, Java is the underlying language that almost all Android apps (besides games and some other exceptions) are based on.

Java at a Basic level is discussed here: http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android/java-tutorial/

But you'll have to know more than that to have a good understanding of Java, so I highly recommend just watching and trying to understand these videos/tutorials until you understand how Java work (If Statements, Variables, Returning Variables, For statements, basic syntax, Basic math operations):

This starting point is really helpful, read each page from here and try and understand what is being explained: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm

Whilst that read-through has all you need to know to start, these videos may help:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBWX97e1E9g

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZIkY55fS0


**Protips before we start**


- Don't give up because it's initially hard, there is always a big cliff where you suddenly just understand what is happening, for me it happened a few weeks after starting my app.


- Google everything, If you have a problem someone else probably has, just Google your question and look for answers, /r/androiddev is another great resource.


- Follow Android Design Guidelines, it's much easier.

**Design Resources**

[Icons and Buttons:](http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/icons-launcher.html)

[General Android Design Resources](http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/index.html)

[Design Inspiration - This is a big one](http://androidniceties.tumblr.com/)

[Google's Design Philosophies](http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/principles.html)

[Android Holo ^^^^^^yolo Design Index/Info](http://developer.android.com/design/style/index.html)

Android Studio has a drag and drop editor for the design part of an app, but you'll have to learn the XML part as well in basic (spoiler: It's quite straightforward): http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html





**Android Development: The Basics**


So you might have gathered that Android Development is not exactly the same as Java development, so I highly recommend watching this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z149x12sXsw (Just to get started).


**String Resources**

This one might seem silly at first, but as someone who forgot to do this and has to redo it all now: DO NOT AVOID THIS.

A string is a sentence, character, word, numbers and a combo of them all.

They are used all the time: for dialogs, debugging, textboxes, UI and more.

The problem is that if you have 700 lines of code and you want to find 1 string to change it in the future (or translate it), it becomes extremely fiddly - so Google created a solution, a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.

So if you had a standard string for dialog like: ""This feature is not available in the Free version, would you like to purchase the pro version? (Don't do this to often!!)"" which you use several times, all you'll have to do is change the String in the Strings.xml file and it will affect all the dialogs.

This also makes it super easy to translate (My biggest regret in my app - I'm working on it).

Google have a more thorough breakdown here, and as a heads up, there are equivalents for this method for numbers and other variables! : 

http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html


**Comment and Document**

Try and comment and document everything you do, want to do and have done (even just a dot point with a feature).

Eg:

//Scan for video files

*insert code here...*


**Some more Basics and how to start:**

Open Android Studio and create a new project, following all the prompts, then it will create all the main files and folders necessary automatically.

With what you have learnt use these resources, your ideas, what you have learnt and any other tutorials to start making a basic, then more complex app.

[Navigation Drawer](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html)

[Toasts - popups](http://www.mkyong.com/android/android-toast-example/)


**Libraries**

Think of libraries like pre-made code that make completing a task in code much easier.

For example, my favorite library: 'IO Commons' shortens all File manipulation tasks into one line bits of codes, where they sometimes might be 10+ lines - this made my app significantly easier to code.

There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the Action Bar on older devices.

Libraries differ in how to add them to Android Studio, so you might have to research how to add them to Android Studio.


**More advanced Pro-Tips**

- Just like the String resources method, don't hard code anything - workout out how to most simplify and make adaptable your code for future changes (especially translation and when you become much better at development)

- Stack Overflow and YouTube (and /r/androiddev) are your friends.

- Follow Google Guidelines.

- If you don't really understand some code or how to do a particular task, Google it, comment what you are trying to do and ask around.

- Use libraries wherever you can.

- Here are a lot of awesome Android feature breakdowns and how to implement them: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/android.html


**That's it!!**

I may not have been as specific as I could have been, but I'm a bit tired (I've been away for a bit!), but the gist of it is that the more you pursue and the more you give it a shot it will begin to make more and more sense until you understand it like a language (hehe).

For anyone wondering, the app I made is Redirect File Organizer.

I'm only 16 years old so my knowledge and my development skills may not be perfect but I've tried my best to put this together for anyone to learn the basics of Android Development. 

My spelling and wording is also rushed, I've just come home from a holiday and It's late here in Australia, but it should be understandable.

I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone might have!

I hope I helped someone!

2020-04-25,1587840647,"Opinion: Mainstream reviewers (The Verge, MKBHD, etc) need to start putting serious pressure on Android apps / app developers","At this point, no fancy hardware feature, no Android system update, no stock-like ROM or anything you can imagine will ever bring your experience on Android to the next level. We've nearly reached the limit and everyone knows it. Improvements are extremely incremental and largely don't change how you interact with your device on a day-to-day basis.

Your time on the lock screen, the home screen, looking at the notification shade, tweaking a few niche settings to your likings; those are small moments in time. What you look at and use large and by far *are the apps themselves.*

With all that in mind, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that mainstream tech reviewers continue to harp on the same strings:

* xx GBs of RAM
* 8xx Snapdragon with +7% of performance you'll never see or use
* Screen body ratio
* etc

All this while arguably the most important piece of the puzzle is ignored. 

When mainstream reviewers are doing (for example) their showdown comparisons of the latest iPhone vs the Samsung, iPhone vs the Pixel, etc, they should be mentioning that a good portion of the Android apps are absolute dogshit. Call them out specifically such as Snapchat, Instagram &amp; Facebook. They should of course acknowledge that it's not the phone manufacturers fault, but really start giving the heat to these huge mega corporations for their continually awful treatment of Android users. I pay the same monthly bill as an iOS user on Spotify for half the experience.

On top of inserting it into occasional reviews, (which is fair as they should be reviewing the overall experience, not just listing specs and first impressions) they should also be writing articles about it. Make some noise about it. I'm aware that a few have been written in the past, but they've all gotten very quiet about it in the past years and it's helping nobody. 

If mainstream reviewers continue to shout ""If only my phone had 2 more GB of RAM! If only my screen was 0.2"" larger!"" then that's all we're going to get. Ever.

On the other hand, if the awful app experience starts to generate bad press to everyone involved, who knows, companies like Google &amp; Samsung might even take initiative to cooperate with app developers to create a better experience. Snapchat might eventually snap &amp; officially support select flagships for stock-app-like camera quality. Same with Instagram &amp; Facebook. Beyond camera quality, Samsung &amp; Google might start giving out some ... *ahem* ""incentives"" for major app devs to clean up their act.

Windows Phones were absolutely crucified for their app support. I don't know why Android seems to be getting a free pass. I'm a huge Android fanboy, and I think the only way things are going to improve is if the people with a real voice in the tech community start putting it through the ringer.

2011-04-02,1301770748,So I was invited to an iOS vs Android battle this afternoon.,"My father in law, a long time Apple fan, and technology fan in general invited me, an Android fanboy, to a lunch with his parents to talk about Android phones as well as the iPhone to factor which would work best for them.

At first I thought he just wanted to have a lunch to just be nerds and battle it out in a civil fashion. So I created a list of items on which to speak. One must do their prep work ahead of time.

Background is, I was one of the very few losers to wait in a, small, line for a T-Mobile G1. I've been a fanboy since. My competitor has been on iOS since iPhone 1. Brought his iPad (I don't have a tablet, but did bring my ChromeOS notebook to show the seemless market to phone install, and ChromeToPhone as well as a prepared cost analysis Google spreadsheet).

Android Features (I added ^'s after finding it wasn't just me vs him and would have to be more civil than expected and tailor only points that might interest them)
1) Live Wallpaper ability

^2) Ability to use Widgets

3) Ability to side load apps without Jailbreaking (Such as Amazon App Store Alternative, unless on AT&amp;T)

4) Amazon Cloud MP3 Player (does NOT require sideloading an app, it's on the Android Market)

^5) Free Built-in voice turn by turn navigation from Google. Mapquests on iPhone is bad, used it.

^6) Notification system that doesn't force interrupt what you're doing. Can swipe down and tend to tasks when 
you choose.

^7) An app drawer. Apps aren't forced to a desktop, like every modern operating system in the world other than iOS. Makes for what can be a simplified screen experience.

^8) You can move app icons anywhere you want. Ties in to 7

^9) 3.7"" Screen (I'm using Droid Incred)(Coming 4.3"", iPhone 5 which is thought to be a fall release, not at Apple conference June 9, is said to be 4"" and yes, the Bionic will have 'retina display' resolution, again before I knew we were discussing phones for others)

10) 8MP camera

11) Native Gmail app

12) Over the air app purchasing from market.android.com (Never plug phone in to sync, ever, unless you want to 
use it for file storage)

13) Ability to have Adobe Flash

^14) LED notifcations

15) a BACK button (home/back/menu/search, Android users come to never want to be without these)

16) Custom Lock screens without jailbreaking

17) Custom notifcation sounds for sms/email/whatever you want

18) Pinch on home screens to leap (Launcher Pro/ADW/Sense/More)

19) Custom Home screens if you wish (I'm using Launcher Pro)

^20) Huge one is Voice recognition by Google, iOS sort of has one but it's been rated terribly and can't do the ""listen to Bobby Darin"", Navigate to, Email contact message, and all of what voice search can do.

^21) NO having to use iTunes, ever, hooray.

22) The ability to download anything you want from a website.

23) Ability to add/swap SD card

24) Full multitasking. You can have, Google Nav going, music playing, Last.FM finding a station based on your music, Skype going, IM's, SMS, E-mail notifications, tethering, all simultanious and switchable. The option to drain or not drain ones battery life. (I've used the scenario listed here while traveling cross state)

25) TV-Out

26) Free NFL live Redzone (Verizon)

^27) Price

28) Chrome to Phone (OTA web URL transmission)

MOST OF ALL, you can customize any of it the way you want.

These were to be my main talking points. After quite a bit of back and forth, they decided on the Droid Incredible (which I actually own) as it had the same weight (important to them) and size roughly to iPhone 4.

Considerable points for them.

The navigation was important. They RV a lot. Not having to plug into a computer was important, theirs is very old they said. The voice searching options to assist in not having to type (70+ years old). An actual comment from my father in law was iPhone has a voice search too. So they asked him to say Navigate somewhere, but he could not voice activate that, nor did he have a Navigation tool, just Google Maps with the GPS plot.

An amusing part was when he was showing Shazam (Amazon App store users know we got Shazam Encore and Shoundhound Infinity pay versions free!). His didn't work with the ambient music where we were. So I just said in my phone  ""listen to Matt Dusk"" and it pulled up my songs immediately so he could demo Shazam.

I don't see them using most of the apps that super or even mild savvy users do. Really either phone would work for them. I think having the lower starting cost $.01 on AmazonWireless, and free turn by turn voice navigation was it. Obviously I'm an Android fanboy, and he and I could have gone at it for many hours, but really when it boils down, either phones would work just fine. Really it's always going to be boil down to what the heck does the person want out of their phone. Both Android and iOS work fine for likely half or more of the people buying these things.

TL;DR Android vs iOS brawl, I think possibly Android won this one. Maybe this can be used as a list of pointers for anyone wanting to give an Android vs iOS demo in the future for someone. We suggested actually getting one of each and then in 2 years decide which they liked more, but they wanted the same one so they could help each other.",Android,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/gh81t/so_i_was_invited_to_an_ios_vs_android_battle_this/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

Meaning that they are better on iOS. Like really night and day, maybe slightly better, or vice versa. Lol, I have a Note 10 Plus, Tab S6, and an iPad Pro 11"". Which has 120hz screen, so theoretically makes it feel smoother. And honestly if both Apps are on both platforms, they feel identical. Except Adobe Rush lol. And also the speeds on both feel pretty good, animations are nice and smooth. Also it looks like Apps launch faster on the Note 10 Plus and Tab S6 than then the iPhone 11 Pro Max or Max Pro idk. Or the iPad Pro, but they feel the same really, and I guess the 120hz screen helps with that. And, all that iOS apps are better optimized stuff, tell that to my Instagram app on the iPad Pro, it is useless and unusable. It is cropped, and if you zoom in it looks so freaking ugly and pixilated. Also if you press in the black area around the app, it will start liking and swiping and scrolling on the app. I tried to use it on the iPad and I was giving people accidental likes. At least on Android it will get scaled to fit a larger screen. Let me know your thoughts on your experience on both platforms.

2020-05-31,1590941630,/r/Android's opinions of device manufacturers over time,"**RESULTS**

[Dark theme](https://imgur.com/0GdSiDY)

[Light/colourblind](https://imgur.com/4Z47bP5)

&amp;#x200B;

**METHOD**

I've been learning about natural language processing over the last couple of months, and thought this would be fun project.

I trained a convolutional neural network on sentiment analysis using Amazon reviews from the ""Cell Phones and Accessories"" category. The mean score of these reviews was \~4.2, so I chose to mark scores &gt;= 4 as positive and &lt; 4 as negative. I then trained the neural network on these reviews, until it could consistently predict what a good (4 or 5 star) or a bad (1, 2 or 3 star) review looked like, just given the review's text.

The trained model will produce a value near to 1 given the text of a positive review and 0 given a negative review. Once it was trained on the Amazon reviews, I applied it to reddit comments.


To reduce the number of comments that I would need to test on, I only downloaded comments which contained one or more of the manufacturer's names. This has the downside of eliminating comments that didn't explicitly mention a brand even if it was obviously referenced (""Samsung Galaxy S8"" vs ""Galaxy S8""). This also is a problem if a comment contains more than one name eg

&gt;I hate how iOS is so restricted. I wish Apple would allow us to set default apps, like Google.

In this case, the low sentiment score would be added to both Apple and Google's results, even though Google wasn't the target of the comment's negativity.


Each plotted point is the week's average. I don't think the results are accurate [given how noisy the raw data was](https://imgur.com/i7lliLF) and the [varying amounts of data for each OEM](https://imgur.com/SDP0R8N), but overall trends are consistent with my own predictions.

It's often suggested that Apple is liked more than any other manufacturer on /r/Android, and that does seem to be the case -- the iPhone 11 launch is the greatest maximum point on the graph, though I was expecting more of a drop with the iPhone 7. Samsung's stagnating line was a surprise and may be due to the high prices of recent flagships. Somewhat predictably, the sub's perception of Google is the only one heading consistently downhill given the poor reaction to the Pixel line and other Google products.

I also collected data for Huawei, HTC and Xiaomi but didn't include them in the main results as the number of comments for each seemed too small for a fair comparison. [Here is the graph with them included](https://imgur.com/54dTkN5).  


Again, these findings shouldn't be taken seriously as I'm not using a state-of-the-art model and the comment selection process was as basic as it could get, but hopefully it was interesting for some of you.

2017-03-31,1490986979,Android standby power usage vs iOS,"Hi guys, I'm pretty sure this has been discussed many times previously but after doing some research, not much in depth information could be found on this topic. We all know that battery life on smartphones has been an issue that many users are facing everyday. I've been switching back and forth from Android and iOS while following changes on both software.

Time and time again the iOS software has a significant edge over the Android platform. The average capacity on an iPhone is also much smaller than an average Android phone.

Even with Android's doze feature, we can see that there's indeed a nice improvement on its standby time. After trying out for some decent amount of time with various devices: the Note 5 (Current Daily Device), the Huawei P9 and the iPhone SE, the big winner based on my daily usage would be the iPhone SE. (I use LTE GPS and BT for the Gear S2 on a daily basis)

I can't seem to figure out why the iPhone can have such a significantly better battery life on standby and usage. For example, I can leave the iPhone overnight and lose 1-3% while any android could lose around 4-8% even with a much larger battery capacity (With rooting and installing a bunch of tweaks to make the battery life better). On the other hand, all these phones have a similar on-screen usage due to the bigger battery and different screen size.

My assumptions would be that Android OS handles apps installed on devices much differently compared to iOS but I do not have much knowledge in this. This is why I'm opening up this discussion.

I'd like to know if there's anyone knowledgeably enough on both software structures to explain here why iOS can maintain such a low power standby usage compared to Android. Will Android be able to achieve a similar %/hr standby time like iOS? Hopefully 8.0 will close the gap up.

2018-11-05,1541449807,Android vs IOS phones in terms of longevity,"What do you guys think of Android phones in terms of reliability?

Ive had 2 Samsung Galaxy phones that died due to defective memory modules, the S3 and the Note 4.
Now Im using my dads old business phone, the Iphone 7S, and this one doesnt give me any issues - in terms of reliability.
It does have like 1/10 of the features, though.
The device is constantly updated -&gt; its incredibly optimized. Apple squeezes so much out of less powerful hardware.

Its a pickle, on one hand - I love expandable storage, I need an headphones jack, being able to fully customize my phone without any restriction is a major turn on, but on the other hand..

I dont feel like paying for another flagship thats going to die on me in a few years. 
My brother got his Iphone 6 around the same time I got my Note4, he still uses it (and it runs well, VERY well), while mine is dead (and before it was dead, it became unbearably slow).
And before the Note4 I had a Galaxy S3 that came with a defective memory module, the thing restarts constantly, also dead.

Im starting to lean towards let your phone be just a phone, and get a 256/512gb (non-expandable, remember?..) Iphone + that stupid dongle, so I can listen to music, and pretty much forget that theres an OS that lets you do cool stuff on your device.

What do you guys think? Im pretty bummed by this. I dont feel like Im getting my moneys worth from neither Apple nor Samsung.

2022-09-27,1664294039,Very few Google apps actually support Themed Icons on Android 13,"In Android 12, Google introduced Themed Icons for Pixel, a feature that lets the Pixel Launcher apply Material You dynamic theming to app icons on your home screen. This feature was limited to a handful of Google apps, however, because there wasn't a proper API in place yet. Instead, the Pixel Launcher had a hardcoded list of themeable icons. [I wrote more about how Themed Icons worked in Android 12 here if you're interested.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1483489686408638472)  

In any case, in Android 13, they expanded on the feature with the introduction of [a Themed Icons API.](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#themed_icons) All apps have to do is supply both an adaptive icon and a monochromatic app icon, and if the user enables ""Themed Icons"" in Styles &amp; Wallpaper, then any third-party app that supports the feature will have its icon themed.  

[Before](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&amp;ssl=1) vs [After](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&amp;ssl=1)

You'd think that Google would have added support for this feature for its own set of apps, and if you have a Pixel phone running Android 13, I can understand why you would think they already have. However, the truth is that very few Google apps actually currently support Themed Icons on Android 13. The only reason that many Google app icons appear themed on Pixel phones is because the Pixel Launcher has a fallback mechanism to use its built-in set of hardcoded themed icons if the app doesn't provide one.  

As a consequence, [users of AOSP-based custom ROMs](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1570448481520652288) or [non-Pixel OEM software like One UI](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1573005415134404608) will notice that many Google app icons aren't themed on Android 13. This is because they don't have the Pixel Launcher's hardcoded themed icon list to fall back on. This is easy for custom ROMs to rectify (just add Google's hardcoded list to Launcher3) but it's not something I think OEMs will do (forcing app icons to be themed could be tricky because of IP).

(As a side note, if you use a third-party launcher right now on Android 13, you'll probably have noticed that there's no Themed Icon support at all. This is because Themed Icon support has to be added to the launcher, but fortunately, that code is open source and [available in Launcher3](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1562536678740217856), the AOSP launcher.)  

---

I didn't compile a list of Google apps that actually *do* support Themed Icons on Android 13, but *9to5Google* today [published](https://9to5google.com/2022/09/27/google-apps-themed-icons-android-13/#:~:text=able%20to%20confirm.-,These%20Google,-apps%20actually%20support) a list of only a dozen such apps!

So yeah, hardly any! Hopefully, Google adds proper Themed Icons support to their remaining apps in time for OEM devices to get their Android 13 upgrades. Already the OnePlus 10 Pro and OPPO Find X5 series have received stable Android 13 releases, so more people will be exposed to and aware of this discrepancy.

2015-09-24,1443065693,The Android Vs. iOS argument is all wrong.,"here is why:

the user experience is mostly homogeneous with iOS. this is not so with android devices. you have companies like samsung that have zero respect for the android operating system (you can tell that statement is a little loaded) and then you have devices like nexus that are true blue and everything in between. 

with android you have anything form low end to high end, rootable and unrootable, unlocked boot loader and locked boot loader so on and so on. everyone's experience is different. i have an att note 4. why am i being so specific? why didn't i just say that i have an android? this is because my experience with my att variant of the note 4 is entirely different with that of a person who owns an international, verizon, tmobile version etc. we are not even running the same damn operating system for crying out loud and this is JUST the note 4.  

my point is that yelling that ""android is better than iOS because (insert your favorite feature)"" goes nowhere. each phone needs to be graded on their own assets and liabilities.  

the att note 4 was my first android (i use that term loosely) device. before i knew what was up everyone told me about all the great things that android was capable of like rooting and custom roms. so i bought this sweet phone, cracked my knuckles and went to work. wait... wtf? this phone has no root. what does that even mean? wait, it has a locked boot loader? i was naive. i thought that all of these things were intrinsic to owning an android device. no one told me otherwise. just imagine if the new note 5 ran vanilla android officially. i would eat that shit up in 2s. i digress.

2017-10-19,1508439662,Android Oreo Color Gamuts and Pixel 2 Explained (with image comparisons and sample app),"So with the Pixel 2's release it seems many people have their pitchforks in hand. I'll admit, I was initially disappointed with my Pixel 2 XL's colors and white balance. But after some more investigation, I realize I, too, wasn't aware how the Pixel 2 and Oreo together are changing the way we see colors in Android.

Let me start by a **brief** explanation of gamuts and color spaces. It basically comes down to, what do you define 100% Red, or 100% Green, or 100% Pure White. Maybe your idea of pure white is a yellower than somebody else's. Maybe it's bluer. This what was actually behind the phenomenon of the blue/black vs white/gold dress. (It's blue and black, btw). 

Starting with Oreo, devices and apps can play with color spaces. There is no 100% clear definition on what color spaces they need to use, but there will be three color spaces types: Low, HDR, Wide. Low is generally just sRGB. HDR can be something like HDR10, but we'll skip that for now. Wide is anything that [includes sRGB and 90% or greater of the NTSC color space](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ColorSpace.Rgb.html#isWideGamut(\)). Wide could be DCI-P3, AdobeRGB, or Pro Photo RGB.

So what does this all mean? Well, Android Oreo, by default, displays in the Low range, aka sRGB. If an app want to display something greater than sRGB, then it needs to explicitly state that. An app that does 3D rendering can do that with OpenGL or Vulcan. Normal apps need to add `android:colorMode=""wideColorGamut""`to their AndroidManifest.xml, or use `setColorMode(COLOR_MODE_WIDE_COLOR_GAMUT)` when launching the activity. If app doesn't do this, the colors will be limited to only Low range (sRGB).

Now you may say, ""On my Pixel 2, all my colors look super faded compared to my [insert pre-Oreo OLED device here]"". Well, that's because none of the apps you are using are calling for Wide Color Gamut. Google decided against forcing conversions of color spaces for memory and performance reasons.

&gt;When wide color gamut mode is enabled, the activity's window uses more memory and GPU processing for screen composition. Before enabling wide color gamut mode, you should carefully consider if the activity truly benefits from it. For example, an activity that displays photos in fullscreen is a good candidate for wide color gamut mode, but an activity that shows small thumbnails is not.

Here's where Google failed. So far, I haven't found a single app that uses activities with Wide Color Gamut. Not even Google Photos display images with Wide Color Gamut. The only exception I've found is Google Camera when using the viewfinder, likely because it's using OpenGL. But the moment the image is shot, showing the photo you took is back down to default (sRGB). 

Here's the other issue. There's no way to override the default Low mode (sRGB) on the Pixel 2. Colors won't get ""bumped"" up to Wide Gamut. Google has to add this option at some point, but from the looks at how it's implementing in the OS, when doing this, any application that actually wants to use sRGB intentionally, can't force it happen. As I said before, there are only 3 options: Low/Default, HDR, and Wide. Low and Default aren't separate options for developers.

So what can you do? Complain. Google should update their apps to allow wide color gamut, at least with Google Photos. The Pixel Launcher as well should support Wide Color Gamut. Even Google Chrome doesn't support Wide Color Gamut yet. It's a bit ridiculous to ask developers to start using Wide Color Gamut when first-party apps don't even support it. (By the way, you should ask your favorite developers to support Wide Color Gamut as well). Google should also allow users to set an override for the default color space. Adding something to the API to differentiate sRGB vs System Default is yet another feature Google should add.

What are the benefits of all this? Well, check out these samples:

https://imgur.com/a/BKpM0

That's a Pixel 1, Xperia XZ (running Oreo AOSP), and Pixel 2 XL. Only the Pixel 2 has true wide color support. Also the Pixel 2's camera has much more accurate colors when in viewfinder. Be sure to not only check out the wider range of colors on the Pixel 2, but how much better the grayscale gradients show on DCI-P3 (wide gamut mode) on the Pixel 2. The XZ and Pixel 1 can't keep up.

You can grab a copy of the sample app here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/6yi7yn04yh1qeq8/image-view-debug.apk

Well, I hope this clears up a lot of the confusion that's going around. Also, for Pixel 2 owners, it's just a matter of the software catching up to the great hardware that's, so far, barely been tapped. If you want to try to see if your computer, TV, or device supports Wide Color Gamut, use this picture:

https://webkit.org/blog-files/color-gamut/Webkit-logo-P3.png

If you can see the logo, your device and/or app supports wide color gamut. As I said before, Chrome doesn't, but [FireFox for Android does work](https://imgur.com/KifIbiv).

Edit: As for likely, the ""Where did sRGB option go?"", it's there, just moved around. The option is actually incomplete. [It's not supposed to be a switch.](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/oreo-r6-release/src/com/android/settings/development/ColorModePreference.java#108) It's supposed to be [a list with the following values: Vibrant (0), Natural (-1), Standard (7)](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/oreo-r6-release/packages/SettingsLib/res/values/strings.xml#723). ""Turning on sRGB"" is actually changing the option to Standard. Vibrant is default. The Pixel 2 has Vibrant on by default, same as the Pixel 1. Now that option is in Display settings, meaning you don't have to turn on Developer Options to get to it. The ""muted colors"" isn't from that option. It's from the changes to Oreo itself.

Edit2: So, I'm doing some digging with the Pixel 2 XL. There are three values on the display: Default (0), sRGB (7), and DCI-P3 (9). The Vivid option in Display Settings isn't doing the same as the older sRGB mode option. Regardless of what Vivid is set to, the Color Mode stays the same at 0 and never changes to 7. I can easily change the Color Mode to DCI-P3 with root, but I'm going to see how far I can get without having to resort to unlocking the bootloader.

Edit3: PROGRESS! Got the display to shift to DCI-P3 without root. Working on packaging it up as an app now.

Edit4: I'll probably have something tomorrow. I got it working, but I'm working on making sure it doesn't eat up your resources.

Edit5: Performance is as good as I think it's going to get without rooting. I'm going to test it out tomorrow for a couple hours and see how it goes. Regardless, I'll have something for you to guys to play with by the weekend.

Edit6: Was actually wrong about FireFox, it's just downconverting DCI-P3 to sRGB better than Chrome does. But [Chrome Beta actually supports DCI-P3](https://imgur.com/nd44WFU) if you enable it in chrome://flags

2022-02-27,1645984223,(Discussion - Multiplatform Ecosystems) Iphone-&gt;Mac vs Android/Google-&gt;Websites,"Discussion

* iPhones sync to Macs/ipads, etc in the Apple system. You can continue to type something on iphone and then continue on your mac. Which is great, but you need their hardware. 

* Android (Using Google apps which are typically defaults or preloaded) you can message/take notes/look at photes/etc on your phone and then look at those same things on ANY computer if logged into Google account. 

Why is the Google method not way more popular or seen as the superior platform (IN THIS REGARD, not in general). Doesn't being able to message on your phone, then log into a website on ANY DEVICE,  trump needing an iphone and then your OWN mac (assuming you need that log in and must be your computer)

Thoughts? I've never used iphones and macs, so I'm sure im missing tons of other seamless transitions. But the Google products on phones and using them on ANY computer seems like a massive advantage. I'm sure im missing things. but I get not everyone uses Google apps, but assuming most do, which all their apps have billions of installs, etc. 

Curious what peoples thoughts are? I feel like the VAST majority of talk is about Apples ecosystem, but you never really hear the rebuttle of Google services being an option. Which I find strange. 

(Personal experience I've seen lots of people blown away that you can take photos, and then go to the website and see them instantly. I've done that multiple times over the holidays where everyone can see, etc). And messaging on my work computer using messages.com is great.)",Android,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/t2tlq7/discussion_multiplatform_ecosystems_iphonemac_vs/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2017-10-16,1508132501,Pixel 2 XL Portrait Mode vs. Olympus Pen-F Micro-4/3 Camera &amp; more comparisons.,"Update: I've added separate gallery of comparison photos between the Pixel 2XL vs. Olympus Pen-F OOC (Out of Camera) JPEG's vs Edited RAW images from the Pen-F. https://imgur.com/a/5tVmd

Original Gallery
https://imgur.com/a/xJdG8
I wanted to compare the Pixel 2 XL's portrait mode to my Olympus Pen-F Micro 4/3 camera.

This is one of the higher end Micro 4/3 cameras out right now. I brought the 17mm F1.8 lens (35mm F3.6 full frame equivalent) which is highly regarded for it's sharpness and good rendering. I decided to leave my full-frame at home because I figured if the Pixel 2 could come close to this camera, that's impressive enough.

I also compared the two in HDR Enhanced mode on the Pixel 2. You'll also see some size and screen comparisons that include the Pixel 1 and Nexus 6P.

The store was closing so I didn't get to test as much as I wanted. It already looks sketchy that I was taking phones out of my pocket, putting them back and taking photos with my dedicated camera.

One last thing I wanted to mention is that for some reason, the portrait mode didn't seem to work on the front-facing camera on either the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL. I don't know if it was because it was in demo mode.

I was very impressed by the Pixel XL2. It was very snappy, and felt good in the hand. Lighter than I expected. The LG V30 felt even better in the hand, but I hated the skinned UI and the fact that they didn't include a portrait mode because they consider it a gimmick. It's no gimmick. It's awesome. The Samsung Note 8 just felt like a glossy item that Samsung hopes owners will show off to iPhone users. I felt like that one had a lot of gimmicks.

The Pixel 2 XL felt more low key. It felt premium and it did some awesome stuff without being shouty about it. I mean this thing can act as a real-time translator via speech or camera and the iPhone X can do animoji's. Just saying. The squeeze frame felt pretty awesome because it vibrates and has an animation that makes it seem like you're ""squishing"" the frame. The OIS and EIS on video was crazy good. I'm a Google fanboy and I've already ordered the Panda Pixel 2 XL so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I have owned Samsungs, LG's, HTC, Apple, Huawei and Motorola smartphones, so I think I have some experience with these things.

Anyway, here's the link to see the image comparison. I'll be around if you have any questions.

2017-09-01,1504272842,User compariso of two snapdragon 625 phones - Xiaomi Redmi 4 prime and Moto Z play,"I have owned the Redmi 4 prime for about 6 months, and a month ago, I replaced it with the moto z play. Both devices have 3GB of RAM and are dual sim, with sim cards active at the same time. A comparison of the two devices, I think is necessary for would be buyers.

**Price:**
I got the Redmi on release for 140USD, the moto Z from Banggood for 250USD. 


**Looks:**
Of the two devices, the moto Z play looks very premium. I would put it on par with Samsung s7 on the looks. The Moto Z play also has na oleophobic coating thats lacking on the Redmi. This means the screen on the moto Z has less of an oily fingerprint look. 
The Redmi 4 is a 5"" device which does wonders for usability. The moto Z play is too huge, even for my large manly hands!
**Bottomline:** the Moto z play wins

**Battery:**
The redmi 4 prime has a 4050mAH battery vs the moto Z play with a 3500mAH battery. Thats a 12.5% decrease in the battery. The battery life is however very different. The Redmi often got me 10hrs SOT and 1.5 days of usage. The moto gets me about 6.5hrs of SOT over one day. This is what I miss most about the redmi. 
The moto usually charges in about 30mins to full using the turbo charger included, while the redmi takes upto 2.5 hrs on the normal charger. The moto z play has a tendancy to heat while charging, the Redmi never once heated, or even got warm. I like phones that dont get warm
**Bottom line:** The Redmi 4 prime wins

**Software:**
Can anything compare to stock?
MIUI is really bad in usability and UI elements. Notification system is not the best, and its still running on Android 6.0.MIUI has a habit of over aggressively killing apps in the background. That means apple music and spotify will sometimes just close in the middle of a song. I did everything including deactivating the memory optimization feature, but it did not help. Finally resorted to using a buggy release of LineageOS.  Both devices feel very fluid and snappy though

**Bottom line:** Moto Z play wins

**Camera:**
Moto Z play shines and shines again. I have not had such a capable camera in a phone in a while. I love it. The redmi camera is really bad. So bad that I only used it to take photos of work related items. I find myself now taking pics of random things because of how good the camera on the Moto Z play is.
**Bottom line:** Moto Z play wins

**Display:**
OMFG amoled. Deep blacks! Popping colors. The Moto Z play Amoled trounces the Redmi display over and over again. I get why Samsung sells a ton of amoled screen devices now
**Bottom line:** Moto Z play wins

**TLDR:** Overrall, I like the Moto Z play. It feels premium, great camera, great screen, great software. I hope Lenovorola supports it to Android O and beyond, but Moto has never been very good about software support for ageing devices. I wish I had the Redmi 4 prime screen size and battery life though",Android,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6xejo7/user_compariso_of_two_snapdragon_625_phones/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2017-04-08,1491688017,Android is the only thing stopping Samsung from achieving Apple like control,"Samsung make everything. Their hardware, pretty much *every* component Samsung can create. From memory chips, displays and CPUs, Samsung can make a phone without outsourcing anything. Even Apple can't do this - their components are made by other companies.

Not only that, but they've gotten good at it. The Exynos CPU series is competitive, they have a near monopoly over the OLED market because their screens are downright awesome. They can make a phone from the bottom up, without help (yes ik demand and stuff requires outsourcing, that's not the point).

The only thing they cannot do themselves is the software. They rely on Android and it's clear they don't like it as they seem to be distancing themselves from Google as much as possible. See: Android wear, GApps competition apps, Bixby. Samsung don't have a replacement for Android. Tizen is not made by Samsung and it's pretty bad, the security and ecosystem is crap. So until Samsung make their own mobile OS, they can't get total hardware and software control like Apple. They're very close though.

Thoughts?

Here is another article about the Kirin 970 + NPU: **[Huawei Mate 10 coming on October 16](https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mate-10-coming-october-16)**

&gt;The Kirin 970 places a huge emphasis on artificial intelligence with a new on-board NPU (Neural Processing Unit) that can pull off impressive computational feats on-board the device, like performing image recognition on 200 photos in 6 seconds, versus the 120 seconds needed to do it on a CPU alone. The Kirin 970 also features dual image signal processors to make for sharper and quicker photos.

&gt;The processor features an 8-core CPU, and a new 12-core GPU, but what makes this new processor stands apart it a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to accelerate tasks used for artificial intelligence, with the company claiming the NPU delivers 25 times the performance with 50x greater efficiency compared to a quad core Cortex A73 processor for AI computing tasks.

2015-04-02,1427937878,Time to end this dispute once and for all xpost /r/apple,"On such a crazy day, I figured today would be a good day to finally end this dispute about the Galaxy S6 looking exactly like the iPhone 6.  

My argument will be split in three parts,  but first some release dates

+ HTC One M7  March 2013
+ Xperia z2  March 2014
+ Galaxy Alpha August 2014
+ Xperia Z3 September 19 2014 (tie)
+ iPhone 6   September 19 2014 (tie)
+ Galaxy A5 November 2014  
+ Galaxy S6  April 2015 


**Part 1:** The Galaxy S6 evolved form the Galaxy Alpha line (speaker grill, central usb, vertical antenna lines vs horizontal lines like the iphone 6). Here you can see the difference between the 

Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy Alpha vs Iphone 6 

http://i.imgur.com/KSEOuIW.jpg

And the bottom headphone/vertical antennas are also seen in the Galaxy A5 

http://i.imgur.com/TL3BPRm.jpg

**Part 2:** Yes I agree that the bottom of the Galaxy S6 looks similar to the iPhone 6, but it is not an exact copy. In similar fashion the iPhone 6 has design  cues from other phones 

Iphone 6 vs HTC M7 metal back with horizontal antenna bands 

http://i.imgur.com/u8ohgX4.jpg

iPhone 6 vs Xperia Z line rounded metal

The Z2 was first to use symmetrically rounded metal edges (as opposed to a round back that flattens at the front like several other phones). The Z3 continued this by removing the small flat lip on the sides

Z2 vs z3 

http://i.imgur.com/0o1KskN.jpg

Both the Z3 and the iPhone 6 share completely round edges 

http://i.imgur.com/JbNdSQX.png


**Part 3:** Except for the bottom (which do look similar) The Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6 look very different at almost every other angle (especially the edge version). The feel in the hand is also very different

To conclude you can call Samsung a thief... or you can realize that everyone steals from each other and just enjoy the fruits of competition.

2022-10-30,1667145644,A quick look at the new Astrophotography mode in the latest Expert RAW for OneUI 5 (mainly from the perspective of GCAM),"I was very skeptical of the new Astrophotography mode in the latest Expert RAW - and the look of the tiny video Samsung has selected to demo the feature and also the numerous crashes reported by redditors were not encouraging.

I will need to start the post with a not-so-small side-note - Astrophotography is a very, very wide term going from extraordinary nice art-like pictures like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/xe529t/14minute_time_exposure_star_trails_from_the_iss/) going all the way to the fully scientific extreme of the pictures taken by Hubble to JWST. Somewhere in between there is a place for pictures that look good enough so as to be able to instantly recognize what you see in the sky vs. what you see in the picture with the added bonus of an improved view in the pictures. My absolute best (personal) example for that is [Neowise comet + big dipper + Polaris - taken with GCAM on PocoF1 in a Bortle 3-4 zone](https://i.imgur.com/Q9GthFN.jpg) - side-note - a simple test if any astro photo containing the big dipper is decent is if you see Mizar and Alcor as [different stars](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/mizar-alcor-plough-double-star/) (which somebody with a good eyesight in good observation conditions should also be able to see directly); on top of that star colors are probably more realistic if Dubhe (a red giant) looks more reddish than for instance Merak (those two are ""the pointers"" since they point to Polaris in the Northern sky).

While my picture above was taken in a place with very good stargazing conditions (about 3-4 on [the Bortle scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale)) my tests with S22U so far have been only in my backyard around Bortle 8, so I expect that when I will find the time and energy to travel almost an hour to my better stargazing site the S22U images to also get clearly better.

But even like that the first tests look promising - [here is a photo taken with the main lens for 11 minutes](https://i.imgur.com/or9XvAa.jpg), and [here is a capture from the open-source Sky Map program](https://i.imgur.com/1i0rDPR.jpg) set in Time Travel to the time and direction of the S22U picture - the 3 green dots to the right of Mirach are M31, M32 and M110 which unfortunately the program has labeled one over the other. M31 is better known as the Andromeda galaxy and if you look in the S22U picture you can actually see it as a very faint diffuse object - so indeed initial Astro mode for Samsung is about at the same level as initial Google Camera (see in [this video](https://youtu.be/zu8W3rXcNfg) around the 19 minutes mark their Andromeda image - but taken in a much better location that mine last night).

The location of my backyard makes impossible to get a clean picture of the big dipper so that will have to wait for that stargazing trip.

On the S22U you can also use Astro mode on the other lenses - on the 3x zoom it also looks somehow promising but on the 10x it seems to never be able to finish taking an image.

So is Astrophotography mode in the latest Expert RAW all OK? Actually not 100% so - crashes have to be fixed (and apparently some will be soon according to a post in a Samsung forum) but also IMHO somebody should keep an eye on the visible [vignetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting). Also a form of quick preview (where a preliminary picture is shown after 30s or so) should be added (just so that you can quickly confirm that the phone is well oriented instead of waiting 11 minutes for nothing).

However it is important that now Google is no longer alone in this Astrophotography race, things will definitely get better with more competition, and I am super-curious if Apple could actually jump well in front of both Google and Samsung by using their sensor-shift features for very, very, very long exposure times (average exposure time for both Google and Samsung in Astro mode seems to be under 4-8s to avoid forming star trails but shifting the sensor could easily increase that 4-8 times; OR we could buy a [star tracker](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-star-tracker), then a lot of DSLR super-expensive stuff and finally get a [composite picture like this](https://slate.com/technology/2014/01/moon-and-andromeda-relative-size-in-the-sky.html)).

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/16zjkdw/stop_coping_with_the_poor_performance_of_tensor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a few days ago. There I mainly talked about performance, and a lot of people said performance doesn't matter, their phone is smooth enough etc...

Fine. Screw performance. 

Let's talk about efficiency! Now that we got the data!

The Tensor G3 doesn't have the efficiency befitting a 2023 flagship chip. As many of you have noted, it is 1-3 generations behind.

Why is this?

(A). **Samsung fabrication**

Let's get one thing out of the way: Samsung's fabrication sucks. There nodes are currently behind TSMC in both performance and efficiency metrics. Further their 4nm had terrible yields too, which have reportedly been improved recently. But the efficiency is still lagging behind TSMC. But Samsung's fabrication is not the only thing that sucks.

(B). **Samsung design.**

 What do I mean? Usually when talking about SoCs, the discourse mainly is around the macro-components; CPU, GPU, NPU/TPU, and the ISP to an extent. But these are not the only stuff in an SoC. There are micro-components like the caches, interconnects, memory controllers, DSP, encoders/decoders etc... While seldom talked about, these micro components are as crucial as the macro components.

Let's use an analogy. The CPU, GPU, NPU are like the Engine and Tires of a car. The other microcomponents are like the car's chassis, radiator, electronic system etc... You could make a car by taking the best engines designed by Mercedes-AMG and fantastic tires from Michellin, but if the chassis and electronics is from a cheap Fiat, the car you are making isn't gonna be a good one.

It is no secret that the Tensor SoCs are [not fully custom chips](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency). The original Tensor used CPU and GPU IP licensed from ARM, and the TPU designed by Google. Everything else in the chip was made from Samsung IP. It is believed that Google's strategy is to gradually replace the Samsung IP with their own with each generation of Tensor chips. But I think it's reasonable to believe the Tensor G3 still uses a considerable amount of Samsung IP.

In this [comparison](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16463/snapdragon-888-vs-exynos-2100-galaxy-s21-ultra#:~:text=The%20differences%20are%20in%20the,as%20they%20reach%202.81GHz.) of the Exynos 2100 and Snapdragon 888, it was revealed that the Exynos is worse in several aspects like cache latencies compared to the Snapdragon, which points to the inferiority of the Exynos IP. 

So Google's Tensor is gimped in two ways: Samsung Design and Samsung Fabrication. But it's not the only thing holding them back.

(C). **Google's cost cutting**

It is well known that one of the reasons why Google chose to go with Samsung is cost effectiveness. Samsung Foundry is cheaper than TSMC, and it's a bundle deal as Samsung also designs the Tensor SoC as well as fabricating it. Without doubt, Google got a good contract. This was understandable, as the Pixel 6 and 7 series significantly undercut their competitors. But now that there are price increases, it's harder to justify. 

That's because the choice of Samsung Foundry and Design isn't the only cost cutting going on. Even with the handicap of worse node and IP, Google could still make a good SoC, if they didn't cost cut. 

How?

1.**Bigger caches**

Cache is a very interesting component of an SoC. Putting more cache in the chip will increase performance slightly, but also give a big efficiency boost especially for a mobile chip. See this comparison of cache sizes:

Cache type | Tensor G2 | SD8G2 | D9300 | A15 Bionic | A16 Bionic
:- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:| 
CPU L2 | 3 MB | 3.5 MB | 3 MB | 16 MB | 20 MB
CPU L3 | 4 MB | 8 MB | 8 MB | - | -
SLC | 8 MB | 8 MB | 8 MB | 32 MB | 24 MB

*SLC = System Level Cache.  
*Apple Bionic SoCs don't have an L3.   
*Don't have data for the Tensor G3 or A17 Pro.

As you can see Apple's chips have incredibly huge caches. This is part of the reason why they are so formidably efficient. 

Bionic: Good node, Big cache.  
Snapdragon: Good node, Small cache.   
Tensor: Bad node, small cache.  

So if Google put Big caches like Apple in the Tensor chips they could close the gap with the Snapdragon and rivalling it in efficency, effectively compensating for the node disadvantage.

Now caches take up a substantial amount of space. 16 MB of SLC in the A15 Bionic took up about 4 mmÂ² of space. For reference the original Tensor chip was 108 mmÂ². So the caches take up a good amount of area and will add a few $$ to the cost of the chip, but I think it's a cost worth undertaking if it's going to improve your phone's battery life by like 20%. The resulting Tensor with big caches will still be cheaper than a Snapdragon whose pricetag comes with Qualcomm's fat profit margins and TSMC's high charges. 

2. **Packaging technology**:

According to a leaker, Tensor G3 uses FO-PLP packaging, which is inferior to FO-WLP. FO-WLP packaging is more expensive but it results in a chip that generates less heat and is more efficient. Apparently FO-WLP wasn't ready in time for the Tensor G3. Details are scarce, but I think Google should have tried to integrate it.

__ 

Bottom line;

"" Tensor G3 is a SoC whose efficency is not befitting of a flagship chip.   
"" The main reasons for this are inferior Samsunf IP and node.   
"" But Google could still made a decent chip by putting bigger caches and using better packaging. But they cost cutted and didn't do it.",Android,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/177rfgk/google_should_step_up_their_game_and_stop_making/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2021-07-02,1625195916,Next-gen Exynos x AMD and the future of Samsung flagships,"I just had a small realization thinking about the next Exynos SoC (probably the Exynos 2200)

Will Samsung ditch the Snapdragon 9xx for the S22 (along with future chips on their future flagships)?

On one hand, it would make sense since the Snapdragon 9xx probably won't be able to match the GPU performance on the Exynos 2200. On the other hand, Samsung hasn't really cared about the gap in performance when comparing the Snapdragon vs. Exynos in the past.

If they don't for the S22, will they eventually? Or will they continue to offer Snapdragon in select markets, and Exynos in others?

If they did, us Snapdragon folk will finally understand how it feels to have an inferior device, and the Exynos folk will finally be on top

One thing's for sure. If/when they switch to all Exynos, bootloader unlocking and rooting will be accessible to everyone

2023-10-15,1697350865,My pixel 8 pro review,"**The pixel 8 pro is pretty great**   
edit: *Will be editing this review over time as I add things.*

**Google assistant summarize:**

I found this to work extremely well on news articles and things like this while in chrome. (chrome is the only place it seems to work on for now)

**Battery Life:**

I have gotten about 9 hours screen time with the battery at around 20%. I have extreme battery saver set to turn on around 30%.  I have no complaints about battery life at all. I have screen brightness set to automatic but it's usually around 50%. 

**Cell radio/signal:**

Compared to my pixel 6, I have noticed about 1 bar of signal improvement in areas where I had low signal before. For example at my work it was very spotty with about 1 bar. With the same sim card and carrier everything being the same except the new phone I now have 2 bars and a more consistent connection. Definitely an improvement here. But other phones are definitely better with their radios. 


**Screen:**

This is a beautiful screen. Seriously looks so vivid and gorgeous colors. But man does it get bright! Even in direct sunlight I can see this perfectly. Love the screen. It could have better scratch resistance as jerry rig everything has shown but it's still quite good. Just not as good as apples. 

**Fingerprint Sensor:**

For me, I am one of those weirdos who got lucky and never had any problems with the pixel 6 fingerprint sensor, and the same is true for the pro 8. Could it be faster? Sure, but it never feels slow or unreliable in my experience. 

**Camera Features:**

*Best Take:*

I love this feature. I have used it on previous group photos I have taken with excellent results. Everything works as advertised. I have noticed that sometimes the hair of someone will be a little distorted towards the edges if you really zoom in, but for 90% of the time this feature does such a good job that it's almost impossible to know that it was altered. 

*Magic Editor:*

Moving the person and making cats and people larger or smaller is crazy. Adjusting the sky and everything works absolutely perfectly. I am in awe of how incredibly good it looks and works. Only been a handful of times where moving an object didn't pan out due to the fact that there wasn't enough data to guess what was behind the object when moving it. 

*Audio Eraser:*

Here is a clip example of the audio eraser in action in a large convention from a video taken with a pixel 6. You can easily tell how much better it is.

https://streamable.com/19s2cg    

vs   

https://streamable.com/g20eug

(Turn up volume to the max.)

*Video, photo Zoom 30x:*

I am not a photographer, but I find that the video quality and the zoom is very good. I do find it hard to stay still when taking a very zoomed in photo. But most of the time when taking the photo it comes out well without being blurry. There is no question that samsung zoom at 100x is way better, but I find it quite acceptable. 


**Performance and benchmarks:**

This phone always feels fast for me regardless of the apps I use. I have done multiple apps from banking to games to benchmarks apps and everything in between. The phone never felt hot or sluggish. The performance was very good and very consistent. 

Please see this link for the benchmarks I did:

https://ibb.co/album/SD4FQx

**Temperature Sensor:**

This is definitely an odd gimmick, and I am awaiting the temp to be approved in the usa to use for body temp. I have used it to see how hot soup is and beverages etc. It's interesting, but nothing you would really find that useful imho. However, I did find it slightly useful for hot chocolate and learning what my ideal temp is for just being hot enough to drink. 


**Its a pixel:**

Call screening, magic eraser, and all the features that are apart of pixel phones from the past are honestly the main selling points for me personally. That's what makes pixel worth it to me.

Btw, the haptics on this phone feel incredibly good. Very snappy and punchy when turned up all the way. Typing is a breeze. 


**Closing thoughts:**

Overall,  I love the phone. I got the pro 8 256GB version. I love it even more though for the deal I got. I already had the first pixel watch and loved it. I got a free upgrade to the pixel watch 2 by going with the pro 8. I also got a trade in for my pixel 6 which was $325. Selling my old pixel watch for $150 and combined with the trade in means I got a pro 8 and pixel watch 2 for only $584! It's an insane deal. 

I think for the price it is an excellent deal. However, I think if you get the free watch like I did and the trade in with a phone, it's an amazing deal and well worth it. However, If you paid regular price for the pro 8 then maybe it would not wow you unless the camera features are exciting to you. (They are for me)






**Bonus Pixel watch 2 review:**

I had the first pixel watch. I really enjoyed it and liked everything about it. My only main complaint was the battery life. For me, it did last about 24 hours with the screen off with touch to wake being turned on. I have it set to receive text messages and a few other apps only. So my watch isn't blowing up with notifications. I also sometimes take a short call with it when my hands are full.   

With the pixel watch 2, My battery life feels like it basically doubled. With always on display on I'm getting about 30 hours of battery life which is pretty incredible. The watch is very snappy and fast. Although I feel the same about the first pixel watch. Neither of them were ever slow for me or laggy. The new sensor in the pixel watch 2 has definitely noticed in real time when I get stressed and informs me of such. It immediately suggests taking a walk or doing the breathing exercises. Which honestly is kind of more useful than I thought it would be. It helps you kind of just freeze in the moment when you're freaking out about something and helps you calm down. It's a lot more useful than I expected and it's way more accurate than I expected as well. I got really excited about a desert I haven't seen in the store for awhile that got restocked and it noticed that. Wild. 

Basically, the pixel watch 2 is an improvement in every single way compared to the first watch. I would say you don't need to get the second watch if you don't care about the extra sensors and you're fine with those slightly lower battery life of the first watch. I think either are a fine choice.",Android,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/17896ym/my_pixel_8_pro_review/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2020-02-02,1580680873,In-depth detailed breakdown of my experience with the Galaxy Fold. Aka the stuff the reviews don't mention.,"So my short history with this device was that originally I wanted to get one at launch... which was delayed several months and once it finally was available, it was near impossible to get an unlocked one (Didn't want to mess with an at&amp;t one). Now that its more readily available, but with the fold 2 apparently having large improvements (spen!), I really wasn't in the mood of paying full price for the original... but the interesting thing now is that people are selling used ones for about $1500 which was within the price I was ok with, so I grabbed a 'amazon renewed' one with 90 day return policy. Win-win? So the packaging was pretty sketch. Phone came in a padded envelope. No box no accessories nothing. There are definitely signs of this phone has experienced drops as well ('like new' lol)... so yeah definitely returning this. Anyways lets talk about this thing. 

* So the very first thing I've noticed about the device was that... when it was open it was solid. It really has zero movement and its great. When folded though... its a bit... [creaky](https://i.imgur.com/XiFOxeO.mp4), and not just from me squeezing it a bit hard here, when I pick it up normally I can hear and feel it move a bit. I was told on the subreddit that, its just how it is. It's not the biggest deal after you get used to it, but it definitely caught me off guard the first day.

* Besides that though, the device just feels great to hold. This is the first phone in years that I've felt confident carrying around without a case. the slim folded mode is easy to carry around or use one handed, and when the thing is opened, the plastic protective rim around the screen gives you a decent place to hold on to while doing your thing. Do note the weight and form factor will take a few days to get used to, if you are like me and generally mostly hold a phone with one hand and the other hand is for navigating, outside of typing. It really is just like [a lighter slightly smaller ipad mini with less bezels](https://i.imgur.com/eyUeV6c.jpg) (apple really should put some money into refreshing that line visually). Do note with all glass phones that it will love to slide out of your pants if you sit down, so if you are gonna go case less, jacket chest pocket is ideal.

* So let's talk about the screen... the outer one! Honestly for me its  surprisingly useable. I've used it plenty when outside or at work in a meeting. It's not particularly hard to type on once you get used to it. The screen isn't that different from my old [iphone 5/se](https://i.imgur.com/ZyJ67sF.jpg) and its super easy to 1 hand. If they decreased the bezels, it would be kinda hard to reach the top area. 

* the inner screen... is interesting. People say that you don't see the crease when you are looking directly at it... and that's true, but that is a much tighter view than you'd think. If you have bright overhead lights its real apparent unless you position yourself just right. [This is my bedroom light](https://i.imgur.com/Zd0SIj7.jpg). [At work.](https://i.imgur.com/Cgvfidc.jpg) [At an apple store.](https://i.imgur.com/ZErXjJJ.jpg) So the texture of the phone feels... different. It scrolls smooth enough like one of the better plastic screen protectors, but its still that. The crease in the middle... is quite noticeable especially if you are in landscape and scrolling down a list. But besides these aspects... the screen is pretty damn great for a first gen attempt. It really is the only hdr amoled mini tablet on the market (maybe there is some samsung budget tablet too?) and its great to look at... just gotta spend a half second to position yourself right.

* So let's actually talk a bit more about this device and its use vs any other phone (will use my note 10+ as reference, currently one of the largest flagship phones on the market). In terms of media consumption... it might actually be equivalent or worse or better than any other large phone depending on the content you are watching. [16:9 video comparison 1.](https://i.imgur.com/L7SmNsa.jpg) [Comparison 2.](https://i.imgur.com/g09eX4C.jpg) [Movie aspect ratio.](https://i.imgur.com/U4fvB3J.jpg) The place where the device shines is watching [older 4:3 content.](https://i.imgur.com/xn8GAaT.jpg). [Great for manga](https://i.imgur.com/xhoFTuN.jpg) and books too. Much easier to type on this device too with the larger keyboard. 

* Proper stereo speakers on both sides is really nice. They are on the left 'half' though so depending on how you hold the device in landscape, your palms could be covering them. 

* So if you wanted to get this purely for media consumption... not worth it. Where it gets interesting is other stuff. Do note with how android apps typically work, the screen density does affect if you see the phone or tablet variant of an app and classic samsung's default zoom puts everything into phone view... which sucks. Changing it down to the smallest does change stuff up though. [Here is youtube](https://i.imgur.com/BtHBrae.jpg). [Feedly.
](https://i.imgur.com/xtlwgXb.jpg) [Google Calendar.](https://i.imgur.com/Fmoj6Uw.jpg) Gmail does its split panel view,chrome gives you the tabs at the top and much more. Obviously not all apps on android have robust tablet views, so stretched phone apps often give you less info... but apps that are optimized for tablets typically do give you more stuff on the screen. YMMV on the app. This includes the web as well. Sites behave differently too and might offer you [more or less text on screen](https://i.imgur.com/0nL1NuM.jpg). 

* So lets talk more about one of the key selling points of this device... multiwindowing. As people might have remembered... samsung been doing this for years since the early days, long before android officially supported it in nougat. The way its implemented here... is a bit odd. Samsung obviously took some inspiration from how iPad does it.  Anyways the quickest overview is that once you enable this feature, the primary app is shrunk to around 2/3 of the screen width, while the second app takes up the right. If you add a 3rd, it splits the area of the second app. You can resize the horizontal width, but not the line between app 2 and 3.  You weirdly enough can't add a 4th app outside of doing the floating window. So this is where its weird... in portrait orientation... this  really isn't that useful at all. [Here is a comparison with my note.](https://i.imgur.com/A5HXCJa.jpg)  As you can see, the video is tiny on the fold to the point where... its just not fun to use. In landscape though with some resizing you can do some fun stuff like [run 3 autobattling mobile games at once.] The left app being the primary is also a bit backwards compare to android in general when you do splitscreen in landscape, the right app is the primary one in which switching apps will always switch the right one. (https://i.imgur.com/fJZmpFK.jpg) I do feel like this is a solid start for samsung to experiment with this new form factor. My suggestions is to save how you distribute the apps, and let users do a 4 app grid setup as well. 

* Let's spend a quick second about the weird notch on the inside. As someone who skipped the s10 with its wacky side notch hole thing... this is really awful for the main reason of it cutting into some video apps like [youtube](https://i.imgur.com/vhLMOvx.jpg), and [plenty of games have buttons and ui elements on the corners which makes this unusable.](https://i.imgur.com/FcXGX4t.jpg) Luckily its pretty straightforward to turn this off and never think about it again.

* I'm actually pretty impressed at how much of the basics this device didn't cut (Can't imagine cramming most of the flagship features into a first gen foldable was easy). same camera setup as the 2019 flagships. flagship memory and specs. wireless charging (might be the only foldable on the market with it? Dont know if huawei does or not). Slightly bummed it doesn't support the 25/45w fast charging that the note 10 introduced... but the battery life is great. Better than you'd think for a tablet with only 4300ish mah. Side fingerprint sensor is great and snappy. So much better than the awful inscreen sensors on 2019 samsung flagships! Software also is fully featured, including many things that the samsung tablets cut, including themes, all the good lock apps (task switcher is a bit wonky though, drag an app to enable splitscreen doesn't work). video enhancer mode. Wish you could flip the device into dex mode on the device like the tablets. Hopefully that is added someday. the one thing that's missing that is a bummer is edge panels. I'm the weirdo that uses those daily for app pairs, cropping image tool and quick launch other apps. I know the multitasking bar is the same gesture here... but it would be nice if they added it to the left or something.

* Software updates... is where its weird here. This unlocked at&amp;t model (with like 2 dozen or so bloat apps that I had to disable/uninstall. Jesus) for some reason is stuck on august security update and says its the latest version. I don't really wanna call at&amp;t and see whats up... with me not being a customer with them. I think there are ways to flash unlocked on this... but I'm probably just not gonna bother and return this. Haven't heard any major features being added though, and android 10 update is slated for april.


Overall I'm pretty happy with the device and the idea of foldables. This device is way less fragile than you'd think, and samsung experimenting with floating windows all the way back in the day is paying off finally. Definitely a product line to keep an eye on. Expect huge improvements yearly. If you been wishing you had an ipad mini style device that is pocketable and is your phone... keep an eye on foldables. 


As always if there are any questions, chuck them below.

2014-02-27,1393533884,"Barring some incredible new feature, I think battery life will be the deciding factor for me when it comes to my next phone.","Background: Since I have basically no hobbies and few friends that I really spend time with, I sometimes buy new phones when they come out. For 2013 I went with the following: Nexus 4 -&gt; HTC One -&gt; Galaxy S4 -&gt; HTC One -&gt; Note 3 -&gt; iPhone 5s -&gt; Nexus 5. I still have the 5s and the Nexus 5. 

Generally, hardware features are all pretty good at this point. Others here on /r/android have commented that maybe we're reaching a plateau when it comes to smartphones. I hadn't really thought about it, but I'm mostly inclined to agree. 

**Screen** - I'm perfectly content with the 1080p Nexus 5 and HTC One displays. I'm equally content with the 1080p of the Galaxy S4. The brightness and color accuracy are great on the N5 and the One. The Galaxy S4 looks really nice too, despite it's PenTile display. The only display I'd really improve upon would be that of the iPhone 5s. It's nice enough, but my eyesight is good enough that there is a noticeable difference between Apple's Retina display and 1080p. 

**Camera** - We're at the point now where most smartphone cameras are capable of taking the sort of pics I'm interested in. There is, of course, a big difference between, say, the Nexus 5 and the iPhone 5s sure. For the most part, I can take either phone with me for the day and be confident that if I want to take a picture, my phone can get the job done. That being said, other than batteries, the camera is probably the other place where smartphones most have room for noticeable improvement. Also, if the new HTC One has the purple tint issue like the old One does, it's a dealbreaker. 

**Processor/GPU** - It looks like 2014 flagships will be going with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 series chipset. I'm not especially well-versed in the way that processors and GPUs work, but from what I can tell, this chipset is fast and powerful. My Nexus 5 has plenty of horsepower with some to spare. Same goes for the Note 3. It may be worth noting, however, that there was undeniable lag/stuttering/dropped frames with the Galaxy S4 and the Snapdragon 600 (though the HTC One had a 600 with no issues to speak of). Apps didn't have any problems running on it, it was just Samsung's interface, it seems. 

**Storage** - You can always stand to have more storage crammed into a phone. But, as long as there is a 32gb variant or a MicroSD card slot, that will be enough for me. Others who use their phone for more things that I do will disagree, I'm sure. To each his own. 

**Build/quality** - Plastic and metal have their benefits. I really don't have too much of a preference as long as it's not creaking and it doesn't have big gaps for dust to get into. Just put the pieces of the phone together like you're supposed to and I'll probably not complain. 

**Manufacturer skin/UI** - I don't have an issue with TouchWiz vs. Sense vs. Stock vs. whatever else is out there. They're all usable and it's easy to customize them to the point where you can ignore the parts you don't like. The only hesitation I have is with TouchWiz and the effect it had on the user experience of the Galaxy S4. Throwing the Snapdragon 800 and an extra gig of RAM into the Note 3 solved the issue. Hopefully the Galaxy S5 solves the problem too. 

I'm probably forgetting to mention something else that I'm not really worried about, but that brings me to the thing I *do* care about. 

**Battery life** - With my current setup (Nexus 5/iPhone 5s), I am sometimes left envious of those of you rocking the G2 or the Note 3. Generally, I can get through the day without concern with the iPhone 5s. If I know it's going to be a long day, that's the phone I take with me. That's fine, but sometimes I want to use android instead; I really like the Nexus 5. The battery on the Nexus 5 is good, but not ""great."" I could root it so that I can Greenify the apps that keep my phone awake in my pocket. I don't really want to, but I could and probably will at some point (I know Greenify can be used without root, but in my experience it's much better with than without). 

But that brings me to my point. I don't want to *have* to do that. The Note 3 gets at what I'm talking about. Huge phone, huge battery. I could run any app on that phone and get through the day with 4 hours of screen on time. The LG G2, by almost all accounts, is capable of the same. Not a humongous phone, but filled to the brim with battery.  I understand that apps like Facebook are battery hogs. That's not my fault, however, and I shouldn't have to babysit my phone because of it. ""Don't install the app"" then. What's the point of having a smartphone if part of using it involves avoiding the most popular apps on the planet? The Note 3 had the sort of battery I was looking for. The Galaxy S4 also had good battery, to a lesser extent. The HTC One, Nexus 4, and Nexus 5 were simply not good enough out of the box (unless my batteries were all duds, but I hope I'm not *that* unlucky). 

**tl;dr: your screen looks good; your camera is probably good enough for the picture that I take; your CPU and GPU are powerful enough; you've given me plenty of space; your phone isn't falling apart; if I don't like your skin, I'll figure something out.

2018-03-15,1521144679,Pay close attention to Samsung S9/S9+ benchmarks and how they are performed--it makes a huge difference,"Hey guys, I wanted to create this post to highlight some pretty massive differences I have seen in reviews when it comes to bench-marking the S9+. There is a ton of misinformation or bias. It seems worse than most releases imo. 

Obviously the biggest thing that differentiates benchmarks for the S9 is that there are two different chipsets. The Exynos on the international release vs Snapdragon in the U.S. Any decent reviewer will list which variant they are using, so this is the easiest factor to take into account. 

**HOWEVER** you will want to make sure to cross-reference statements about the performance between the two chip-sets regardless, because for example this is one issue I have been seeing: 

&gt;[The performance of both SoCs should be comparable, as always. Having the different Snapdragon and Exynos SoCs has been going on for years.](https://www.androidpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-performance-review)

Yes it **should** provide similar performance, but it *doesn't*, at least for now. For whatever reason. Per another corroborating source: 

&gt;[On the GPU side for Manhattan fluctuated between 4.5 and 5.2W, which is an improvement over the Exynos 8895. But again, this is still at a disadvantage compared to the Snapdragon 845.](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12478/exynos-9810-handson-awkward-first-results)

So if you are trying to benchmark your phone and compare with official results. Make sure they are of **your** variant. Either the international version, or the U.S. version. 

**Now the next biggest factor in testing that isn't nearly as talked about is:**

How was the SOC tested? Which tests? What were the parameters of the tests? Because it can produce wildly different outcomes. For example, I saw someone link [this](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-s9-benchmarks,review-5199.html) article, and they mentioned how the Snapdragon Adreno 630 GPU was more hype like always, and still underperformed vs the A11. Which if you read that article I linked. You would probably agree with that sentiment, at first anyway. This is what that article stated: 

&gt;The iPhone X got the better of the S9+ in Sling Shot Unlimited, 4,994 to 4,634. But it looks like the new Snapdragon 845 is more adept at handling graphics than its predecessor was.

So what is the issue here? 

Well Tom's guide doesn't state anywhere whether or not this was an on-screen test vs an off-screen test. 

Other, more thorough and reliable sites like Hothardware.com DO list how they benchmark.


Gsmarena also did a great job in listing another factor that could easily attribute to the lower score by the S9 in GPU benchmarks that I haven't seen mentioned in any other recent review. 

Examples: 

&gt;The phones with lower screen resolution would have an edge over the Quad HD Galaxy S9 and that's obvious from the onscreen test. The Huawei P10, Pixel 2, Xperia XZ2 and even the iPhone X - they all have 1080p or similar resolution compared to the 1440p screen on the Galaxy S9.[https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s9-review-1734p6.php]

This is a big reason why on the Manhattan benchmark. You see a MAJOR difference in off-screen vs on-screen performance, and why ""off-screen"" the S9 beats the iPhone X, but the ""on-screen"" test the iPhone X clobbers the S9. The S9 has to push significantly more pixels than the iPhone X. 

With that in mind. Let's see how **off-screen** Adreno 630 numbers compare to the A11 GPU in the aforementioned sling-shot unlimited test. 

Remember Tom's guide said: 

&gt;The iPhone X got the better of the S9+ in Sling Shot Unlimited, 4,994 to 4,634. 

Hothardware.com on the other hand said: 

&gt;**In this test we again run the Offscreen mode, so as to remove display resolution differences from the equation and thus compare cross-platform results more reliably.**

&gt;In Sling Shot Extreme, the Galaxy S9+ maintains its lead over the other flagship Android smartphones in our test group, **and even takes Apple's iPhone X out behind the wood shed for a beating.**

[source](https://hothardware.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review?page=5)

So we can in fact extrapolate that the Adreno 630 in the SD845 is the much more capable GPU, but you won't necessarily see better performance on the S9 (or any other smartphone) vs the iPhone X, only because the S9 has to push significantly more pixels for its higher resolution display. 

I just thought I would share my findings, as it seems like 90%+ of reviewers claim that the S9 SOCs are complete equivalents and/or that at the very least the Snapdragon SOC is under-performing. That isn't true at all.

2016-12-01,1480586096,Why microSD should be dumped in favor of UFS external memory cards in the future,"UFS external cards are basically microSD cards without all the stupid problems for the price of possibly being (a lot?) more expensive than microSD

Besides price, the only other significant problem is the transition of the entire industry to it

In some ways it is similar to USB C and in other ways it is totally different as stated from a old thread i made comparing usb type c to ufs external cards but I still think comparing USB type C to external UFS isn't that silly

Sure, UFS physically looks almost exactly the same as microSD unlike USB type C vs USB type A but both of them are the future and both will have a somewhat difficult transition in order to be widely used in the computer industry (I don't know when UFS slot will eventually trickle down to budget phones .etc)

Enough with the USB comparisons

For those of you who are gonna ask me or think ""Why get rid of microSD option"", hear me out first

My ideal dream scenario is basically this:

It is not necessary to make a socket design that only allows UFS and not microSD 

but Samsung should have a software option of allowing phones to only support UFS cards and not microSD

(Samsung could just make a socket design that only allows UFS but I think a software solution is much more cost effective and elegant)

And some might think

""But bro, why go through all the trouble to disable microSD support? That seems like a terrible idea""

My answer to this is that it is the only way stuff like iPhones (and possibly google phones and the likes) to ever adopt expendable storage

My endgame goal and dream is not just to get rid of crappy expendable storage read/write speeds. My real goal/dream whatever in this is to make this new expendable storage format so great, that even apple will be compelled to adopt it. (Of course if apple adopts it it is likely that pixels,oneplus, and the entire android market all over the world will be compelled too)

2016-05-12,1463073478,HTC 10: 48 Hours Impressions + Comparison With 6P and 6S Plus,"Howdy,

I've been using the HTC 10 for the last few days, and I though I'd take the chance to address its strengths and shortcomings relatively to the Android/iOS flagships.

**Build**

Holy subjectivity batman! Between a Gold Nexus 6P, Rose Gold iPhone 6S Plus, and Silver HTC 10, I'd probably call the 6P the prettiest and the HTC 10 the most solidly built, with the iPhone sitting somewhere in the middle.

I think the visor is absolutely beautiful, but the 6P's screen has, from day one, been slightly pried up on the right edge. I'm also concerned about stress fractures on the visor, and I have to treat the 6P very gingerly. Still, the obsessive use of chamfers and the batman-esque color scheme make the 6P a winner in my book.

The iPhone's antenna lines are horrible, but there's an obsession with symmetry and curves that I appreciate. Every single hole in the unibody is meticulously centered, and even though the design is overall a little boring, it is executed with perfection.

The 10, on the other hand, is a little more slapdash but much more solid. It's not thin, it's not light, but it feels like it can take a beating. The chamfer of doom (tm), is beautiful, and HTC's antennae lines are thin enough to look like design elements. The front is a little mismatched. I know it has OIS, but the selfie camera is awkwardly HUGE and the fingerprint scanner (which is great btw) isn't quite centered within the bezel. I haven't done and won't do drop tests on my babies, but I'd put money on the HTC surviving (and if it doesn't, there's always Uh-Oh protection).

**Screen**

The HTC 10 has the best LCD screen on Android I've ever seen, and it comes dangerously close to the iPhone 6S Plus in terms of overall quality. The 10 isn't especially bright, but it's as colorful/warm/cold as you want it be, because HTC gives you a decent range of calibration options. The screen feels very close to the glass and has fantastic viewing angles. Reviews have mentioned a magenta tint at off angles, and I confirm that behavior on my unit. It's not a big deal at all.

Overall, off-angle viewing is drastically better than the 6P and just behind the 6S Plus. The Nexus 6P can obviously display better blacks and more saturated colors than either the 10 or 6S, but it does so at the expense of whites and viewing angles (the 6P's whites are a sickly gray color). Compared to the latest Samsung flagships, the HTC 10 falls a bit short, but it's a smartphone screen to be proud of. 

**Sound**

I'm not an audiophile, but dang if the 10 doesn't sound good with headphones. It's a litter better than the iPhone 6S, and both are drastically better than the wimpy DAC in the Nexus 6P. 
Speaker output on the 10 seems a little quieter, but much richer than, the Nexus 6P. The 6S Plus' speaker isn't half bad, but it's too easy to muffle entire. The 10 can be muffled, but only with serious effort. However, all three phones are still quieter and less boomy than the excellent Moto X Pure (RIP Moto).

**Smoooothness**

I can't tell much of a difference between these three phones. Most of the time, in most scenarios, they're all going to perform excellently. The loser here is the 6P, which falls behind in gaming somewhat (I mostly play Hearthstone). However, they're all excellent and splitting hairs between them is a strictly recreational, not practical, activity. Remember that even though the 6P falls a little bit behind, it's also drastically cheaper.

**Software**
I won't address the iOS vs Android debate, but damn if I don't appreciate Google and Apple's ability to keep crapware off their phones. My Verizon HTC 10 came with a lot of Verizon's value-added software. Thankfully, it can all be uninstalled or disabled in about 5 minutes. I'm a little concerned that software updates will be slower on the 10, but the bootloader is apparently unlockable so it's not a big deal. 

The HTC Apps on the 10 are actually quit nice, with Clock and Voice Recorder being my favs. I use the Google Now launcher because I'm a newsfeed addict, but HTC Home isn't bad at all. Minor complaint: HTC persistently shows an icon when NFC is enabled, and I haven't found a way to get rid of it. Minor praise: HTC shows the battery percentage in the status bar legibly, something google is apparently incapable of.

**Battery Life**
iPhone 6S Plus &gt; Nexus 6P &gt;&gt;&gt; HTC 10

Yesterday, I got 4 hours of screen on time with 14 total hours off the charger on the HTC 10. It also played about an extra hour of Apple Music in the background*. Is this more battery life than most folk will ever use in a day? Yes. However, the Nexus 6p (~5 hours SoT) and 6S Plus (~6 hours SoT with 10 hours of apple's weird ""usage"" metric) are both superior. I use roughly 4 hours of SoT every day, so the HTC 10 is workable, but not quite ideal. For most folk the 10 will be fine, but I'm hoping a software update can give the 10 a little boost.

*Apple Music is less buggy on Android than Google Play music is on iOS. I like both services, but at this point I mostly subscribe to Google for YouTube Red.

**Camera**

I am not a camera guy, but I will say that none of these phones has ever given me a problem. The 10 does get the best background blur effect of the three, but dang if I don't have to manually dial-down the exposure every time I take a picture. I can take comparison shots if anyone wants them, but if you're not doing pro-photography I don't think you can come away from these phones disappointed.

**Conclusion**

I really like the HTC 10, and it's a huge improvement over the One M8/9. However, I wish it had better battery life. It's the best phone, in my opinion, at its size, but unfortunately then again the 5X is half the price and still a very good phone. I hope HTC hasn't priced themselves out of the market, because the HTC 10 is a compelling phone with an excellent build, great screen, and killer performance.",Android,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4j1r8t/htc_10_48_hours_impressions_comparison_with_6p/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2020-02-28,1582923221,"Why I Love my Pixel Slate: A Brief 2020 Review Vs the Competition (iPad, Galaxy Tab, Surface)","Okay this isn't that brief...sorry. See TL;DR at the bottom.

I was in the market for a new tablet or tablet-like 2 in 1 device that I can use for both web browsing and media consumption as a tablet, and as a competent productivity device, eg multitasking apps, and windows, note taking, emails, document writing, and web apps for my job etc. nothing crazy intensive so no content creation, art, programming etc.

My needs were:

* Preferably at least 6GB of RAM
* Up to date processor that can handle multitasking
* Minimum 1440p display
* Keyboard included w/trackpad
* Native mouse/trackpad support
* External device ready capability
* Proper file management
* Preferably around 10 inches
* Headphone jack
* Price Range &lt;$500

As an Android fan, it was pretty disappointing to see the limited amount of android tablets that could even fit \*most\* of that bill, which lead me to a pretty difficult decision to make for my needs.

Here is a short review of each, *compared to the Pixel Slate,* of why I chose not to buy it.

Surface Go

* I like the size, love the surface keyboard, and running full windows means native x86 app support.But at this price (at the time) it only opened me up to 4GB of ram, which is just not a great experience on Windows.
* Windows is simply \*not\* a proper tablet UI...at all - It's a laptop first and foremost
   * Touch response feels slow, sometimes requiring double taps to confirm, the touch keyboard is unresponsive and really laggy, often doesnt automatically open when clicking on text boxes/search bars, very few optimized apps for tablet use, barebones gestures, etc.

Samsung Tab S5e

* The 10 inch, AMOLED display with Dolby Atmos speakers would makes this a great media consumption device.  Samsung DEX mode makes productivity the best Android tablets have seen so far
* But only 2 years of support, no headphone jack, a slow 6 series Qualcomm processer and only 4gb of RAM and running mobile browsers only makes the $500 price tag seem like a joke.

iPad Pro 2017 10.5

* Several years of support, 120hz display, without a doubt the most powerful device here.
* Lack of proper trackpad/mouse support - the accessibility feature doesn't fit the bill. But ultimately iOS and the Apple ecosystem led me to not buy this, which I almost did.  I have absolutely \*no desire\* to mess with iOS and its apps that youre forced to use. No set-default browser/app option, using google services is more cumbersome, multitasking isnt as good as ChromeOS, Windows, and in \*some ways\* DEX mode on Android, watered down adblock and extension support, not full desktop browser etc.

This brings me to the Pixel Slate

We all know this thing was a joke at launch, too expensive, stupid slow Celeron processor, and ChromeOS was a mess. These things have all been worked out a year later, and I love it. I bought the Core m3 version on black friday for $450 that included the keyboard and pen.

The build quality, high resolution display, excellent battery life, great keyboard/trackpad, and dual front facing speakers make it a joy to use. The Core m3 processor and 8GB of ram in the base model has been plenty for me.

As for the software, ChromeOS has seen *a ton* of improvement since it released. No bugs, glitches, lag, etc. Not quite as smooth as the others in some cases here and there, but mostly great. The tablet mode is familiar, gestures work great, and Android Apps, at least the ones I use, work perfectly well.

Full-desktop browser support on ChromeOS makes it so that you can actually use this machine for work (depending on your needs of course) and take advantage of proper plug-in support and adblocks. Plus, its supported for another 5 years.

Only thing i'm not a fan of is that there is no headphone jack, something I \*really\* had to swallow, the keyboard hinge could be better, and I wish there was an 11 inch version as 12 is a bit too big as a tablet, but something you can get used to.

TL;DR

All of these tablets have their use cases, but for me the Slate in 2020 feels like that perfect hybrid tablet device many people are always looking for. It's a great tablet with Android apps, smooth gestures, awesome screen and battery. But it also has a proper file manager, multi-display support, native mouse/trackpad support, and desktop browser which makes it a really competent work device too.

I highly recommend looking into one if you're in the same situation I was.

2012-11-02,1351851266,So I just switched to Android after using iPhones since the original in 2007,"As per the title, I just made the switch in the last week. It was a tough decision, what seemed like a lifetime of living in Apple land was a lot to give up. My biggest concerns were how well I could integrate android into my current setup, the quality of apps available, quality of the phone itself, whether or not I would find myself missing anything etc. iOS is something I've come to rely on and it's painless syncing with the mac was a big win for me (running exclusively macs here). 

So I took the plunge and got myself a Galaxy S3 on O2 here in the UK. Chosen the s3 based primarily on a few key factors: I wanted something well supported by the community, I wanted expandable memory, and I wanted a well specced device that wouldn't be made immediately out of date. I think I made the right decision.

Now onto the important bit, android vs ios in my own view. Firstly the bad bits, the available syncing solutions are a little haphazard, certainly nowhere near the seamless thing that is ios and iTunes. I still haven't worked out a way that will work for me, my primary things are syncing music, pod casts etc and doing it wirelessly without user interaction and maintaining things like play counts. Stuff like contacts etc are sorted because both android and mac osx have good support for Google services which I used previously anyway. The next issue I've found backups, I still don't really know how that's done. On ios it was all done automatically when I charged the phone, it would connect wirelessly to iTunes and iCloud and back everything up. Anything like that for android? The only other bad bits that stick out are mainly minor refinement issues in the os, but it's not worth going over because it's more nitpicking than anything else.

Now the good bits. Androids greatest strength compared to ios is the fact you can change pretty much anything and get much finer control over your apps and the os itself. I love this. I love it so much it makes ios look like a child's toy in comparison. And apps on android have so much more freedom to enhance the user experience. Take the Spotify app for example which I use a lot on both platforms. The android version blows ios out the water, it looks better, it integrated with the os better and it gives you much more in the way of sound options. This could not be done on ios thanks to apples restrictions.

I also love being able to customise anything I don't like. I've since changed the launcher, keyboard, widgets and setup timed profiles using Llama (something I've sorely missed since my old Nokia 6630 days) and I love LOVE being able to do more than one thing at a time. I download something in the browser while posting on reddit using BaconReader and listening to music on Spotify. True multitasking. Not the multitasking-but-only-if-we-like-it kind that was on ios. Oh and one last thing, I love the fact default apps can be changed and the fact I can share anything with anything else. I can post stuff to Pocket from anywhere now, not just apps that explicitly provide that function. Hallelujah! 

Anyway as you can tell, I like android so far. I'm still concerned about backups and syncing so if anyone could offer any suggestions for those that would get great. Also one little thing that concerns me is that while this freedom is great, it does allow apps to misbehave and eat data and battery when they aren't needed, something I've encountered already. Apples closed system was limiting no doubt, but it did provide a consistent and relatively trouble free experience, I really hope I can achieve the same kind of thing here.

Anyway thanks for reading, my apologies for the long post and feel free to comment, criticise, enquire :-) 

UPDATE: I'd love to know people's opinions on the best Reddit client. Using Bacon at the moment. Also any recommendations for a gallery replacement application that can pull in Picasa and Facebook images too. The stock s3 one is good but it doesn't let you size wallpapers correctly for launchers that allow for images that span across homepages. It seems Samsungs launcher likes you to have one set wallpaper size. I'm using Nova.

UPDATE 2: Thanks for all the info guys. I now have music syncing done via iSyncr and playback via PowerAmp. I will be using Tasker to control this more to my liking. Im also looking into Google Music, particularly now they're track matching. Also I should note that one of the reasons I went android is for the sheer power and flexibility, we're only really limited by imagination and not by any one corporation (such as Apple). I jailbroke my iPhone a few times and it was always a bad experience, the system just wasn't designed to be used like that and everything was a bad hack. On android its obvious it was designed to be a lot more open, it makes nerds like me feel at home. And once Ive had this phone a few more weeks, I shall be rooting and customising the lot. I saw one guy mention Terminal in the comments, well I practically live in the unix Terminal on the mac as well as my Linux machines so thats something I'll be looking forward to on Android too :)

UPDATE 3 (I promise these will stop eventually): Being able to SFTP to my mac from the phone is a god send. Using Solid Explorer here and it makes transferring files from almost anywhere simple as. Doing the same on an iphone was both difficult and pointless, because you couldn't actually do anything with the files once you'd transferred them, well nothing outside the one app you were using anyway.",Android,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12iaqx/so_i_just_switched_to_android_after_using_iphones/,neutral,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2017-09-22,1506073919,Unraveling the 4K at 30fps vs. 60fps video recording conundrum on the Note 8,"**Summary:**

Note 8 ships as Snapdragon/Exynos variants.  They support 4K at 30fps video recording, but that is a limitation of the Snapdragon 835 variant.  The Exynos 8895 variant can potentially support 4K at 120fps.

Will Samsung release an update just for the Exynos variant, or will they refrain from breaking Snapdragon/Exynos symmetry.  If they don't they risk losing on one of the features vs. iPhone X (supports 4K at 60fps).

----

**Details:**


The Note 8 supports 720p at 240fps and 4K at 30fps (recording) and 60fps (playback).

Compare this to the iPhone X supporting 1080p at 240fps and 4K at 60fps.

However, there were reports that the Samsung website advertised 4K at 60fps for the Note 8.  So there was expectation of an update:

- [Note 8 Camera Update to 4K 60fps?](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-8/how-to/note-8-camera-update-to-4k-60fps-t3672701)

- [The Galaxy Note 8 also has 4K at 60 FPS video recording coming... soon](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Sorry-Apple-the-Galaxy-Note-8-has-4K-at-60-FPS-video-recording-coming_id98082)

However, it was later confirmed by Samsung that the 60fps was a typo:

- [Samsung's Galaxy Note8 is not getting support for 4K 60fps video capture](https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung039s-galaxy-note8-is-not-getting-support-for-4k-60fps-video-capture)

&gt;Earlier today, it was reported that Samsung updated its product listing for the Galaxy Note8 to say that the device will support 4K video capture at 60fps. As it turns out, that was just a typo, Samsung has confirmed to Neowin, and the product listing once again says 30fps.
&gt;
&gt;Even though the information came from an official product listing, it was a bit curious. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset only supports 4K capture at 30fps, and that's the SoC that the device uses in the United States. Interestingly, international variants use Samsung's in-house Exynos 8895 processor, which can support 4K capture at up to 120fps.
&gt;
&gt;What that means is that if Samsung wanted to implement the feature, it would only be able to do so on certain models of the Galaxy Note8.


Like other Samsung S and Note series devices, the Note 8 ships in two variants:

- Snapdragon 835 (SM-N9500) for the U.S. market
- Exynos 8895 variant (SM-N950F) for international (as is the tradition with Samsung)


While the Snapdragon 835 specs support 4K at 30fps recording and 60fps playback, the Exynos 8895 supports 4K at 120fps recording (i.e. clearly superior) - this opens up the possibility of Samsung providing an update that unlocks the faster fps for the Exynos variant of the Note 8.


**Politics of Snapdragon/Exynos symmetry breaking**

Whether Samsung will be able to do that - risking ire of Snapdragon users as they fall behind - which may prevent them introducing this asymmetry in features between Snapdragon/Exynos.  However, Samsung also has the iPhone X breathing down it's neck - which would prevent Samsung touting Note 8 as beating iPhone X in all matters comprehensively.

If nothing else, some rooted solutions from xda-developers etc. may wind up enabling 4K at 60fps on the Exynos 8895 variants of the Note 8 possibly.

2020-04-29,1588148042,Am I living in a parallel universe?,"SO thats a question im asking myself the last few days while reading about the new IPhone SE everywhere.

All reviews im reading or watching ( LTT , Dave Lee , etc.) are talking about the great value of this new device. But i can not wrap my head around it. 

Im one a Samsung Galaxy A51 and fail to see how this new IPhone is even close to being a ""value for your money"" phone. BUT before everyone is going ahead writing how this phone has the best mobile processor on the market - hear me out first ..

All im doing is writing Whatsapp Messages ( yea im in Europe, Germany - there is absolutely no point in iMessage over here ), browsing reddit, watching Youtube Videos ( which is amazing on such a nice big AMOLED Screen ) and taking photos ( which is super nice with the variety of cameras on the back and totally enough for my personal use - i dont need super professional photos for pesonal use on my phone and its got 128 GB of storage for everything )  While all these tasks can be done for a very long time due to 4.000 mAh battery 

Now the big thing is that all these things run smoothly - absolutely no problems whatsoever. Do most people really do more with their phones? Im talking about more demanding tasks.

From my point of view everybody fails to talk about real Budget phones ( Do they even exist in their world ) Its always about ""Big new flagship here - big new flagship there - flagship killer over there - OH THERE IS AN IPHONE FOR 479Â¬ THATS HUGE BANG FOR BUCK ) ... while im on my device thats 289Â¬ of the shelf and looking better for everything i do.

Where am i going wrong? Do i fail to see why the processor is such a big deal on a phone thats doing nothing for professional use? Do Tech reviewers dont know about things like the Galaxy A-Series? Or any budget Series for that matter ( I dont care at all about brands ) 

Im absolutely not bashing on Apple or Android or anything else - i really want to understand what im not seeing. Maybe someone can help me out here.

Or maybe im not the guy to know about brand-value .. maybe im just living in my own parallel Universe lol

Edit: Guys. I didn't mean to be rude - my intention was simply to understand the other point of view. There is no need for another 80 comments to point out that software support is important and how my phone will not run for 5 years but the iPhone does ( even though my SO got a Galaxy A5 (2017) which runs perfectly fine ). I do understand that (very) important argument. But nonetheless - I do still think they could have made the SE more 2020 than 2016 - still give it a good price tag and still give it software support. 
That said, please be nice to each other, I just wanted to be educated ! :) Peace to the apple folks out there

Edit #2: I've read A LOT of your comments and came to a conclusion. As someone in the comments pointed out - yes I'm living in a parallel universe. It's called Europe and is apparently ( including the res of the world ) totally different from the US I'm terms of Smartphones lol - ultimately it's like metric vs. imperial system ^^",Android,1673,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ga5htj/am_i_living_in_a_parallel_universe/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2020-04-13,1586812777,The Ultimate Betrayal of Samsung... Exynos 990 vs Snapdragon 865," **This is an honest review, I have had Samsung devices from my teen years; S4, S7, S9+ and ultimately S20+.**  

Samsung truly betrayed me after a 6 year long being an advocate of their brand, and often would recommend a Samsung smartphone device to others...the Exynos 990 is total trash, it keeps throttling after 1 hour of progressive intense gaming (pubg and codm), which even an Apple x would not even have trouble with... The game starts to drop in performance to 15fps which makes it unplayable for a casual gamer. While my previous S9+ didn't even have a problem with... 

Also after extensive research of other reviewers, I came to notice that other customers in Europe and Asia would also encounter this issue because it is a device with Samsung made Exynos 990. The difference between the Snapdragon 865 and Exynos 990 is the difference of 20 - 25% of GPU processing powers of the chipsets. Basically, a customer is paying for a device that is the same with a worse specification which is provided for the United States and South-Korea... They trully admit that their chipsets are faulty... However, I can imagine this would put them off and there won't be a healthy contended for Qualcomm...

Tomorrow I am heading to the post office, I made the decision today to move on to an Oppo Find X2 with the actual chipset that worth paying for...I felt disgusted and ripped from the back, they lost a personal customer...

After having done all my research the past day between the difference of Exynos and snapdragon, you should do your research before buying this phone right now. Search between: Snapdragon 865 vs Exynos 990..

2019-07-29,1564416636,"Why having the headphone jack is still better than anything else. (vs Bluetooth, Lightning/USB-C headphones)","Hey guys, you might have noticed a pretty deceiving trend for like 2-3 years now. The headphone jack has disappeared from a lot of smartphones recently, however, it's starting to come back a little bit (notable with the ROG Phone 2, Google Pixel 3a...). Removing the headphone jack is an absolute anti-consumer choice,  even if you don't listen to music that much or if you use bluetooth headphones, you still don't have a single reason to defend the removal of that port, you may have personal reasons to use Bluetooth but you have no reasons to defend an anti-consumer practice like that.

That being said, here is all the advantages that an headphone jack gives to the user:

* Way better sound quality. As sound is an analog thing and the jack is also analog, it goes pretty well. The sound on an headphone jack is the absolute best you can have if you're not a true music enthusiast using full-sized jacks.
* No latency. Especially, on Bluetooth peripherals. This is a very bad problem with Bluetooth sound right now, it's starting to become way less of a problem than before but it's still annoying.  The latency problem is especially real when you try to watch livestreams, about 20 minutes or more after starting to watch, you will notice that the sound is starting to desync with the video... Making bluetooth an unusable system for livestreaming purposes...
* No interferences. Again, this is especially noticable on Bluetooth. The more of BT peripherals you use, the more you are prone to interferences. If you got too much of this peripherals, you won't be able to sync your headphones at all or would be victim of an horrible sound experience.
* No concerns about battery life. If you use Bluetooth, you will need to charge your headphones before using them. Even if it's like every 1 or 2 days.
* You can keep a well built jack-based headphones for a decade. As Bluetooth headphones uses Li-Ion batteries, they have a short lifespan, however, a jack headphone don't have that problem.
* The most easy-to-use connection for headphones. You don't have to tweak in the settings or try multiple times to sync your headphones. It just works (&gt;!Oh, that reminds me of Bethesda's E3...!&lt;).
* The most reversible port for audio. Simple enough, the headphone jack is just a circle, that means that you can put it any direction you want. USB-C/Lightning is only reversible on two sides.
* You can use multiple headphones with it. Using a simple headphone splitter (usually included with your headphones unless you use earphones...), you can listen to music along with your friend. It is possible on certain circumstances on other connection types, like the select few phones that allows to connect 2 BT headphones or one of the dongles for USB-C.
* No shitty dongles needed. If you already got an headphone jack on your phone, you don't have to be scared to break something that a fruity company sells for 30$. You don't have the risk of breaking or losing a tiny adapter. Also, those dongles still can't be at the same level of a native headphone jack.
* Headphone Jack cables are more durable than USB-C. I've seen a lot of USB-C break when you simply use them for charging (It was however a large progression over MicroUSB which could break by only charging 2 times.)
* You can connect some specific peripherals to it. A lot of TVs this days are still using IR Remotes, with an headphone jack, you can simply bring back the IR port if you need so, or use a Radio Emitter. Yep, those are specific needs for certain types of peoples but the option is still nice.
* It gives you more option. Even if a phone has an headphone jack, you can still use Bluetooth or USB-C headphones, it simply gives more choice to the consumer.
* The headphone jack doesn't really take that much space. Take a look at the iPhone 7/8, they didn't used space ""gained"" by removing the headphone jack, in fact, every phones except a couple of very tiny ones don't use that space.Also, Samsung managed to provides a 4000mAh battery, IP68 certification and a stylus that's as long as the phone with the Note 9, along with the headphone jack. Asus managed to put a 6000mAh battery and a FAN inside the Rog Phone 2, also with a jack. The headphone jack doesn't take that much space inside the phone...
* You don't want a phone that's thinner than an headphone jack. Companies will say that the remove the headphone jack for making their phone thinner, however, a phone that's as thin as a paper page isn't ergonomic and nice to use...
* You can use your headphone jack across every device (except a few smartphones). You can use an headphone jack on every console as of right now, every computer (except Macs but again it's Apple), every recent cars, every TV... USB-C headphones are only compatible with a select number of devices where Bluetooth is still missing from certains consoles...

&amp;#x200B;

The headphone jack is still, as of right now, the best way to connect headphones. I'm not saying that in future years the USB-C audio wouldn't be better than the jack but as of right now, removing it is one of the most stupid decisions you can do when making a smartphone right now... You wouldn't get anything by removing it...

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend everyone to boycott, if they want to, every phone without a jack, even if you don't care, this is just an anti-consumer decision...

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, this is a 200 years old connection but as of right now there's not any better alternative, so why remove it?

From our experiences, I've realized that neither iPhone nor Android is superior. iPhones are known for their seamless integration with other Apple products and regular updates, while Androids, like the Pixel and Samsung Galaxy, offer great customization options and a variety of features. Ultimately, both have their pros and cons, and the best choice depends on personal preference and needs. As a die-hard Apple fan, I dont know why people think one is superior to the other.

2019-03-14,1552563569,Unbiased opinions for Samsung's Galaxy Buds vs Apple's AirPods,"The AirPods are one of the best purchases i've made in the past several years. They've integrated themselves into my day-to-day life to the point where I literally felt lost / depressed / disappointed in myself if I forgot them at home one day instead of slipping them into my pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

The Galaxy Buds had some big shoes to fill and I've been looking forward to getting them ever since switching from my iPhone X to the Galaxy S10+ for various reasons of personal choice. How do they fare?

* Sound Quality - The Buds can't compete with the AirPods. Music on the AirPods feels more punchy, bass-y and generally a lot livelier than that on the Galaxy Buds. That's not to say that the Buds sound bad at all, but if I have to compare them side by side with Apple's unit, the point clearly goes to the AirPods. I also noticed the AirPods felt approx 20-30% LOUDER than the Galaxy Buds at max volume, which was very surprising considering the AirPods were not in-ear and the Buds are. I generally like my volume on the louder side and hence prefer the AirPods in this department.
* Portability - both cases fit equally well in my pocket. The point goes here to Samsung since I now have the convenience of being able to wirelessly charge the case through the back of my S10+.
* Shape, size, ergonomics - this is the straw that broke the camel's back for me. My personal usage for the AirPods is a. either at the gym / going for walks where I have both AirPods in my ear, b. at my office where I have one AirPod lodged in my left ear, or c. at home after our young daughter sleeps where my wife and I share one AirPod in one ear each while watching content on our larger iPad
* The AirPods are just.... easier to handle, and easier to deal with. I can put them in my ear and take them out quicker and in a more comfortable manner, as funny or odd as that may sound. I am also personally not too fond of in-ear headphones so the AirPods felt easier to manage where I don't have to intermittently clean them because of ear wax splotches here and there even though I clean my ears daily.

  
Overall i'm happy I have both the AirPods and the Buds to use in different situations where needed - just thought i'd share my feedback after approx 48 hours of using the Buds. If you guys have any questions feel free to let me know.

The main difference I can see is that the SGS3 has a wider lens. This, in turn, means that when pixel peeping at 1:1 objects have a bit less detail. In terms of white balance/color/contrast they're very much alike, the iPhone having a bit of a warmer tone. Exposure was a bit of a pain in the ass, as the SGS3 has no ""touch to expose"" function (why the fuck not, Samsung?) so you have to either choose ""matrix"", ""center weighted"" or ""spot"", while on the iPhone you just tap on what area of the picture you want to expose for.

2022-04-06,1649261079,I've used every Pixel phone. Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro after months of use.,"Hey guys,

Pixel phones have been some of my favourite phones over the past years. Ive had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship thats come out. While the Pixel 5 was a really good phone overall, I wished for a more premium phone from Google as it missed some key features like the zoom camera, better haptic motor, and speakers. 

When Google announced the Pixel 6 lineup, I was cautiously optimistic. On paper, the phones seemed to be the best Pixels ever. So, I went ahead and got both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. Here are my thoughts on the phones after using them for about 5 months.

**Design and Build Quality**

I think Google got a lot right with the design and build quality of the phones. Both phones feel premium in hand. While it was great to have a metal back in the Pixel 5, the plastic coating made it feel like a budget phone last year. I also like that we got to have more colour options this year.

While Google got a lot right this year, they werent able to hit a home run on everything. Both phones are quite big and somewhat heavy. I wish Google created a smaller model as using the phones with one hand is quite challenging. Im also not the biggest fan of the glossy back. I think the frosted white from the Pixel 4/XL was the best feeling material Google had and I wish they did something similar this time around.

On the bright side, Google used a much higher quality haptic motor this time. Both phones have some of the best haptics on Android devices. 

Also, the speakers are way better this year. The sound quality is pretty nice and I had no issues with calls or playing media during my time with the phones.

**Performance and Battery Life**

Pixel phones are known for their buttery smooth performance and clean UI. Even the Pixel 5 was able to be incredibly smooth with mid-range specs. So, it was not surprising to see the Pixel 6 perform like a true flagship. Everything is buttery smooth here and I noticed some processor intensive tasks to be a lot faster on the Pixel 6 vs the Pixel 5. For example, apps install much quicker on the Pixel 6 compared to the Pixel 5.

I dont game on my phones, but for everything I used the phones for, the Pixels delivered some of the fastest Android experience Ive had.

Battery life has been pretty decent in my experience. Both phones easily got me through an entire day. I found the Pixel 6 battery to be slightly better than the Pro. This could be due to the difference in antennas. Both phones would typically have over 30% by the end of the day. While this isnt as good as the iPhone 13 Pro as I typically have around 40%-50% battery left by the end of the day, Im pretty comfortable with the Pixel 6s longevity throughout the day.

**Screen and Fingerprint Sensor**

The Pixel 6 has a 90hz flat screen and the Pixel 6 Pro has a 120hz curved screen. To be honest, both feel just as smooth. Its very hard to tell the difference between 90hz and 120hz. But compared to 60hz, both phones feel incredibly smooth. Also, both screens get bright enough for easy day time viewing, so no concerns there.

I personally prefer the flat screen of the Pixel 6. The curved screen, while it looks more ""premium"" doesnt offer the same user experience as the corners are desaturated and there are some accidental touches here and there.

The fingerprint sensor on the phone is absolute trash. This is one of the worst fingerprint sensors Ive ever used. It has gotten better with updates, but it still misses like 50% of the time when my hands are very dry. It's particularly bad outdoors for some reason. Ive tried scanning my fingers multiple times, but that still doesnt fix the issue. This is almost a dealbreaker as this is one of the only biometric unlock methods and Google doesnt offer face unlock. I really miss the rear fingerprint sensor from the Pixel 5. 

**Software Experience**

I have mixed feelings about the software. Performance wise, the phone absolutely flies and offers some of the best Android experience. Even comparing to new flagships like the S22 Ultra, I feel the Pixel is smoother in day-to-day use. 

However, I feel Google is taking a step back with Android 12. While it looks prettier than older releases, usability has gotten worse. For example, theres no more wifi toggle. You have to go to internet and then change your wifi. You cant get rid of the at a glance widget on the home screen, which I dont understand. The only way you can have a clean home screen is through a third party launcher, but then the animations arent as smooth when youre multi-tasking unless you root the phone. Also, not sure if this is a widespread issue, but I found notifications on the Pixel 6 to be slower than the iPhone 13. Emails notifications in particular took a minute or two longer than iPhones to show up.

On the other hand, theres a lot of stuff to love. Google is offering 5 years of security updates, which is way better than most Android phone makers. Call screening is still one of my favourite features and I wish more phones had something like this. I also really like the new widgets you get with Android 12. They really add to the fun vibe Google is trying to create with Android 12.

Also, Pixel 6 has some of the best voice recognition Ive experienced with a phone. The phone instantly recognizes everything I say. It really makes you feel like youre living in the future.

I hope Google starts to offer a mode similar to Dex on the Pixels. As phones get more powerful, itll be great to expand the ways we use our phones.

**Camera**

I have mixed feelings here as well. Google was the king of smartphone photography for at least 3 years and it was one of the main reasons I used Pixel as my daily driver. This is also the reason I started [ShotbyPixel](https://instagram.com/shotbypixel) years ago. This year, I was very excited about the cameras as Google finally changed the sensors and offered more than 2 cameras. On paper, Google was set to be the camera champ once again, but reality ended up being quite different.

The ultra wide angle camera isnt wide enough. The quality is quite average and the shots I got werent as nice as the iPhone 13 Pro or Samsung S21/S22 Ultra. The main camera took stunning pictures most of the time, but it also missed more than previous Pixels. Also, I feel Google went overboard with the processing. Photos have a very digital overprocessed look to them at times, which Im not a big fan of. On the bright side, the bigger sensor gets some nice shallow depth of field. Its good for closeups, but not great when taking photos of documents as the camera isnt able to focus on entire documents.

The selfie camera is also quite average. I like that its wide, but I wasnt a big fan of the end result.

The telephoto camera surprised me in a good way. I love the shots that I was able to get from the camera. The 4x telephoto really lets you [frame photos in a way most phones dont](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbn7dgl4nZ/). Also, the short minimum focusing distance almost makes this a macro camera as well. While I dont think most people should spend the extra money to get the Pro for the telephoto camera, its worth the investment if you take a lot of photos.

**Final Thoughts**

I think Google got a lot right this year with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Both phones look and feel great, and offer exceptional performance and software experience. Plus the price of the regular 6 makes it very easy to recommend to most people who want an iPhone like experience on Android. I hope Google continues to invest in the Pixel ecosystem. The phone has a lot of potential, but the lack of accessories such as a Pixel watch really work against it when compared to Samsung or Apple phones. If Google is able to improve some of the software issues and fix the fingerprint sensor, the next Pixel has a serious shot at being the best Android phone. For now, I think the Samsung S series still provide a better overall experience due to the ecosystem and features.",Android,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/txpl6k/ive_used_every_pixel_phone_here_are_my_thoughts/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

**Reasoning:** The post explicitly lists a comparison of Android",,,,,,,,
2017-04-27,1493253067,"My Opinion on the S8 vs the Google Pixel XL, Oneplus 3 and Iphone 7","Hi everyone,

I just wanted to give everyone a little perspective on my thoughts of a few recent phones that I've used as daily drivers and how they compare to the S8. I know a lot of people are on the fence about jumping ship to a samsung device and hopefully my experiences can help some of you. I have also had an S6 edge in the past so I am able to use this for any comparisons.

* Just to be clear, both the Pixel and Oneplus were used as daily drivers however the iphone was not. I have had consistent access to the 7 yet it was never my primary phone.

**Display:**

This is the first time i have ever decided to purchase the smaller variation of a phone and honestly I have no regrets doing so. Most other phones that have a smaller version tend to have some pretty significant tradeoffs, however the S8 was first major flagship to be relatively even. Hands down the S8 display is the best. I think most of us can agree on the fact that Samsung is the standard when it comes to displays and the infinity display only amplifies this. Colors are rich and saturated (arguably too much so for some) and really pop off the near bezel-less display. Ease of use is also the best as the phone can comfortably be used one handed. One thing I would like to mention however is that although the s8 is rated at 5.8 "" vs the Pixels and Oneplus 5.5"" the overall screen size (area) is only 2% larger because of the s8's taller aspect ratio. This can either be perceived in a negative or positive manner as the screen is still plenty large, just not maybe as much as some may have hoped. 

The Iphone, Pixel and Oneplus all have great screens respectively, however they are not on the same level as the s8. The only real reason I can think that someone would prefer one of these screens over the s8 is due to the reflection based on curved screens.

*Winner - S8*

**Design:**

Although I know design preferences can be subjective I think it is fair to say that from an aesthetic standpoint the s8 is a marvel of design. It is the first phone that I can honestly say won me over strictly based on its feel in my hands. Being IP68 is also a large plus. My only gripe with design is the all glass back. It looks amazing however is a fingerprint and scratch magnet.

My second favourite design is the Iphone 7 followed by the Pixel and then the Oneplus.

*Winner - S8*

**Fingerprint scanner:**

This is where the S8 in my opinion is the worst of the bunch. Yes, the placement isn't the greatest, yet for the normal s8 it is not to hard to get used to and becomes very familiar within a few days. My problem with the S8 has to do with the sensor itself. It is the only phone out of the bunch that I associate with misreads. It is not a deal breaker by any means, yet definitely noticeable. Moreover, from what I've read and seen online, the S8 uses the same materials as the s6 for the sensor itself- meaning that it is easy to scratch. All of the other phones (IIRC) use sapphire glass and are very hard to scratch. While my s8 is currently immaculate, the s6 is the only phone I have ever owned where I have been able to noticeably scratch up the button from normal use. Im fairly certain this will happen with the s8 if I neglect to use a skin/case

The best scanner of the bunch easily goes the Oneplus. It is the most responsive and accurate. The Pixel and iphone are tied for a very close 2nd.

*Winner - Oneplus 3*

**Battery and Charging:**

This section is a little harder to judge based on the varying sizes of the battery for the batteries. Efficiency wise nothing trumps the iphone however I am more concerned of raw hours of usage. The Pixel and Oneplus succeed in this regard based on their larger batteries, with the Pixel being my slight overall winner. This being said, the s8 and Iphone can last me a full day with a single digit percentage amount by the end of the day (7am - 11pm). I find this more than acceptable as I consider myself a power user. All 4 phones are respectable in this aspect given their varying battery sizes.

Charging is a little bit of a different story. The iphone is the clear loser here with its slow as molasses charging protocol. From there the battle really boils down to qualcomm quick charge vs dash charging. Dash charging is the fastest charging protocol and really has to be experienced to appreciate. It is not miles faster than qualcomm, however when we're talking about full charges for all these phones in a little over an hour, a 5-10% advantage is nothing to scoff at. The problem I have with Dash charging however is its proprietary nature, as both a Oneplus dash Charger AND Cable are required. This easily runs in the ballpark of $50 (cdn) and the hassle of shipping. Qualcomm charging devices are much more accessible and cost friendly. Also the fact that I can use my laptop charger on the s8 and pixel (for fast charging) is a gigantic plus.

*Winner - Pixel XL and s8* (I have picked both as the s8 gets roughly the same battery life as the smaller pixel and the reviews indicate the s8+ is similar to the Pixel xl)

**Camera:**

I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Phone cameras on flagships have evolved to the point where it almost comes down to personal preference. In blind tests it is hard to distinguish between the s8, pixel and iphone 7. This being said, the oneplus slightly lacks in this department and is the worst (albeit still great) of the bunch. From there I have to give the pixel the slight advantage based on its low light performance. I dont personally take selfies so I cannot comment on that aspect.

*Winner - Pixel (barely)*

**Software:**

I am not going to talk about the iphone for this section as by this point you are already either committed to android or ios. I for one cannot stand how notifications are structured on ios and avoid it. In addition, my opinion on software reflects my everyday usage and not speed tests or benchmarks. I use all these phones in the same way and my thoughts reflect my opinion of this usage

From there it comes down to stock android vs touchwiz. While I appreciate the additions oxygen os adds to stock android, it does not trump the full stock experience of the Pixel. The pixel is just so smooth and buttery plus first in line for updates. 

Touchwiz on the s8 is a mixed bag. I actually like the additions it makes to stock android as many of them are very useful. this being said, the actual performance of the s8 is the laggiest of the bunch by far. Multiple times throughout the day apps will struggle to open up in a timely fashion and scrolling will struggle. I wouldn't consider it enough of an issue to fully dismiss the phone, however coming from both the Oneplus and Pixel it is VERY noticeable. I am actually baffled by how more tech reviewers have not brought this to light in their reviews, especially given that most of them use the Pixel as their daily drivers. It is possible that future software updates could fix this, but with samsungs track record I wouldn't count on it. If you were to have someone non tech savvy use these phones i can guarantee you that they would not guess that the s8 has the newest processor.

*Winner: Pixel*

**Overall winner: S8**

While both the pixel and s8 tied on a category basis, the margins of victory for these was much larger/personally important in regards to the s8. The one handed nature of the phone plus its water resistance are 2 features that i don't know if i can go without going forward. In addition the micro sd support is a giant plus given the rising popularity of VR. The Pixel is still an amazing phone and I am having a VERY hard time replacing it. This being said, my recommendation for the average person debating between the 2 phones today would lean towards the Samsung.

There was some earlier posts but I think they were deleted for not being self posts. 

The only problem with the early release is no one has cases.

Happy to answer questions while I'm mowing.

Edit 1: is there any battery app of community preference I can run over the weekend and then post results on Monday? I'll be at a wedding so traveling, a few photos etc.

Edit 2: does anyone know how to activate the increased full photo resolution storage?

Edit 3: I have awoken. Thanks for all the great comments and questions. I'm unlikely to get to them all because of life and work but I will endeavour to get to a many as possible this morning and on Monday I will post some screenshots of the GSam battery app to see what has been using up the battery.

I also thought I would try to tidy up some more common questions into this post rather than look all over the place.

[N5 vs Pixel w/notification light](http://i.imgur.com/bpqISwi.jpg)

[N5 vs Pixel side comparison](http://i.imgur.com/GWEdeTw.jpg)

Ambient display: This currently only lights the lockscreen up when a new notification is received. There is no facility to sneak peek the lock screen with 2 or 3 taps.

Assistant: It starts with the OK Google command from screen off but you have to be fairly loud and clear compared to activating when the screen is on.

Battery: Very basic and early stats. Taken following running both Geekbench4 and Antutu.
[Battery GSam/Settings](http://imgur.com/a/tMhbH)

Boot animation: The coloured balls jump over each other.

Buttons: Satisfying clicks. The volume key has a bit rattly movement.

Carrier Bloatware: Nil. There is no indication on the box/phone or software that the device was sold through an exclusive carrier (in this case Telstra)

Camera: Using FV5 and shutter priority the longest exposure is 0.6"" (seconds)

[Autofocus](https://youtu.be/aQcB4JcmZz0)

Earphones: The included phones are noise-isolating with silicone tips. 2 spare tips in the box. I'm not audiophile so take assessments with grain of salt. They are clear, even at maximum volume, you could share music between 2 or 3 people just holding them between ears - but you have a phone speaker for that sooo... While they are clear, they do sound hollow, with better highs than bass.
I can't detect any hissing when music or audio is paused.

Encryption: on by default.

Magnetic back: No, and I recommend not trying it in case your phone throws a mild tantrum like mine may have.

Maps/Compass: The direction cue on Maps is MUCH more accurate than my N5 ever was. I'm sitting inside and the delay between a spin of the phone and the cue catching up with accuracy is 0.5s

Photos backup: It automatically recognises photos that were taken while owning a Pixel and uploads in full resolution. There's a little note in the ""backup + Sync"" setting in the Photos app

Pre-installed apps: So all of those types of apps - Allo, Duo and many of the other ""extra"" Google apps aren't pre-installed. When setting up the phone it gives you a list of apps you might want with a check-box, these being among them

2020-04-03,1585878900,Old phone (LG G7) vs new phone (Samsung Galaxy S10 5G) bullet points/mini review,"So yeah. After only 13 months of using LG G7 ThinQ, I switched to Samsung Galaxy S10 5G. 

Why, you may ask, and the aswer is simple; I have been using LG phones for 5 years from LG G Spirit aka budget G4 to budget G5 (the SD670 model) to G6 finally G7. I have loved every single one of them and I still do but I needed a breath of fresh air. The G7 also felt bit lackluster when it comes to RAM management and I had sometimes bit of a trouble with typing with so ""small"" screen and seeked bit larger screen too. I am actually writing this with my G7 and I am having bit more trouble than normal.

So when I got to shopping for a new phone I wanted phone with oled screen and in-screen fingerprint scanner and 3,5mm audio jack. I went to look for LG V40 honestly, but it wasn't sold in my country anymore as LG phones are really hard to get in northern Europe and anything newer wasn't sold either. The V50 never arrived and G8x was sold only in one place for whopping 950Â¬, so I skipped. Then I saw Samsung Galaxy S10 5G for 799Â¬ and saw good reviews and thought that I could give it a shot. After all it had all of the things I hoped for.

So I wanted to do quick comparison after 20 days:

What G7 does better in my opinion:
-Screen has better white balance, S10 5G's screen looks yellow-ish
-Flat screen, no accidental presses while watching a video
-Software is better, but older version, but I still prefer it because mire customization and the phone feels more like home than flashy mall
-Price was 50% cheaper when I bought it and it wasn't discounted
-Quad DAC
-I feel more safe with MIL-STD-810G than without it
-Design. It feels better and safer in hand
-Fingerprint scanner is faster and more reliable
-Better with AoD management and detecting when phone is in a pocket

What S10 5G does better in my opinion:
-Cameras are way better at least in dimm areas
-screen is OLED but has worse whites. So I give plus to both because why not.
-Included virus scanner even though it is McAfee aka McJustDon'tUseIt
-Fast charging is actually fast compared to other Samsung models or QuickCharge 3.0
-Bigger screen helps with typing experience
-Always-on display is more visible in the sunlight
-Better internet speeds, but I changed operators less than week after getting the phone so it probably has more effect
-Face unlock is even bit too fast
-Newer android so dark mode is included
-More RAM and internal memory
-2 device Bluetooth pairing and playing audio at the same time

So, my thoughts are quite mixed. On the first hand I need to get used to curved edges and software that I don't prefer before judging completely.

On the other hand though I feel tempted to switch back, but I won't simply because more ram makes listeming to music without tidal crashing way more enjoyable experience. But I am kinda thinking about selling this phone to someone amd getting G8x or next phone that is coming from LG's flagship models. See, I am a tech nerd, I like my phones to be top end phones when I get them even though I'm not needing to get best specs out there.

2018-02-17,1518884334,Android Oreo Smoothness Comparison: Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel,"I made a smoothness comparison between a Google Pixel running 8.1.0 against a Galaxy S8 running 8.0.0 beta 6. The Pixel is about 2 weeks old, and has much fewer apps installed than the S8. I used GPU Profile Bars to measure the time it takes for each frame to render, which is a pretty good way to measure a phone's smoothness. 

## Result: 
**https://streamable.com/uax42**

## How to interpret the result?
The length of the individual bar indicates the time it took to render each frame. Longer the bar, the longer it took to render. The horizontal green line is the 16 ms mark, which is how often a 60hz smartphone display refreshes. Any bar that crosses the line isn't being rendered in time when the screen refreshes. Please do note that the results do slightly vary between multiple trials, especially for non-cached scrolling. 

## Verdict
The S8 showed some surprisingly impressive results. [Here is the S8 Nougat at launch vs. the Google Pixel.](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25-980x913.jpg) As you can see, at launch the S8 didn't have amazing smoothness. However, after receiving the new Oreo update along with Samsung Experience 9.0, it seems to exceed even the Google Pixel in certain areas. 

**Edit:** To add in, the S8 is the Snapdragon model on T-Mobile with the same resolution as the Pixel (1440p). 
Also, I've tested the performance of more Google apps on the Pixel here: https://streamable.com/1dqpw

2019-03-13,1552510546,Samsung Galaxy vs Google Pixel: In depth performance analysis.,"I think this is a topic people have not openly discussed. So I decided to make a single thread to lay out the facts, so at least people can make more informed purchasing decision. I will be objective and fact-based as much as possible. Here is how the 2 phones compare in performance:

## Frame drop test:

**Samsung wins.** [Pixel 3 vs Note9 frame drop test.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP_DDOt3qmY&amp;t=574s) Could not find any other recent ones. Old tests [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7y7jbs/android_oreo_smoothness_comparison_galaxy_s8_vs/) show OG Pixel and S8 (Oreo beta) have near identical frame performance.

## Touch latency tests:

**Tie.**  Samsung does have hairline advantage after viewing multiple tests at 0.25x like [here](https://gfycat.com/lonelyfastharrierhawk). But the difference is negligible (0.1 s difference) to make it a winner. I was able to find a better touch latency comparison of Pixel 3 [against the OnePlus](https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1058650315300503552), but not for Pixel 3 against Note9.

## Multi-tasking test:

**Obvious Samsung win** due to more RAM, according to any speed test videos. Slightly faster app launch on Note9 vs Pixel 3 as well.

## Subjective performance reviews:

**Samsung wins.** Far more people have complained about longterm performance on the Pixel 3 than on any of Samsung's recent flagships. Editors from [Android Police](https://twitter.com/RDRv3/status/1094345113063514112), [Droid Life](https://www.droid-life.com/2019/02/25/the-pixel-3-is-pissing-me-off/), [The Verge](https://twitter.com/vladsavov/status/1077863839377563649), founder of APKMirror [Artem](https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1024367645892591616), and [MKBHD](https://twitter.com/mkbhd/status/1024732405373063169?lang=en) all complained about their laggy Pixel performances. Meanwhile all the long term reviews (Android Police, 9to5Google, Hardware Canucks, Geekyranjit, Nick Ackerman, Floss, AndroidCentral) of the Note9 have said performance has been great with no degradation.

## Verdict

Based on the above analysis, it seems Samsung has matched if not exceeded the Pixel in performance many areas. It's impressive how far Samsung has come a long way from its old days. Hopefully this means Google will take performance more seriously down the road as well.",Android,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/b0r89a/samsung_galaxy_vs_google_pixel_in_depth/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

I am having a hard time picking. I am wondering what you would base off your decision.


The Good:


*What pulls me to the S4 is the SD card and removable battery. On top of the many accessories Samsung has.


*What pulls me to the HTC One is its beautiful hardware...nothing compares to it. 


The Bad:    
*What pulls me away of Samsung S4 is it's plastic (but I will end up putting a cover anyway, so whats the big deal?)    
*What pulls me away from the One is no sd card and removable battery 


What would you chose and why?



**EDIT 1** : Looks like I will most likely get the Galaxy S4 GE. Thank you everyone for responding/helping me out with this. I am sure when the time comes, people can revert to this thread if they are stuck making this kind of choice.

Okay, let?™s break this down. You?™ve clearly",,,,,,,,
2021-02-25,1614293059,OnePlus 7 Pro vs Galaxy S21 Ultra (longish),"I made this switch recently and wanted to share my thoughts for anyone who might be considering it.

My 7 Pro is very close to my perfect phone. The reasons I decided to upgrade were, in decreasing order of importance:

- battery life had recently become much worse. I baby the batteries on phones as much as possible, charging to 87% or less unless I'm going to be away from a charger for a long time, never going below 25%, disabling the FB app and accessing it by browser only, etc. This kept my 5t's battery in perfect shape for years, I still had 7+ hours SOT with it when I retired it. Still, over the last couple of months my SOT dropped by 30-40% on my 7 Pro.

- I've been doing more and more outdoorsy stuff and wanted a better camera

- I have a lot of microscratches on the screen caused by debit/credit cards in my wallet case. Once I noticed them I took the cards out but it's pretty annoying that plastic cards can scratch Gorilla Glass. There are 3 horizontal lines of microscratches that you can't see on bright content but you can on dark content

- The phone has gotten a bit stuttery at times. Nothing major but sometimes the notification shade will get stuck in the down position and I have to turn off the screen with the power button and turn it back on to reset it. Or app switching will be a bit laggy. I'm not a power user by any means and I'm not running intensive apps but it definitely feels slower than it did a year ago.

- I feel like OnePlus phones don't get a lot of or consistent updates

So, I decided to go with the S21 Ultra as it is very similar to the 7 Pro:

- almost identical screen size

- high res + high refresh rate oled

- in-screen fingerprint sensor

- all of the above + better cameras, giant battery, s-pen support, the aura of actually owning a true high end phone vs ""best bang for the buck"" mid-range phone which I've always gone for in the past

How do they stack up? Things the S21 Ultra does better:

- the 10x zoom camera is amazing and overall camera performance is just better. Sometimes by a little, sometimes by a lot. With one exception (listed below)

- screen is better. The 7 Pro screen is very very nice but side by side the Samsung wins. Whites on the 7 Pro are slightly yellow, greys have a bit of brown. To be fair, you'd never notice on its own, only if the two are directly compared.

- Samsung has a ton of bloat and software but some of it is really useful. One-handed mode is great, side-tray is great, their camera app has so many options as to be almost overwhelming but really gives you the ability to get the most out of the cameras with tons of features.

- it is definitely faster, even for a non-gamer. 

- big ol' battery that lasts a long time, helped by the variable refresh rate among other things

- brighter screen in sunlight

Things that are different but equal between the two:

- they both feel great in hand, but very different. The OnePlus is more curvy and slippery but the glass back looks and feels amazing. The flatter surfaces on the Samsung also feel great and it's less slippery. I use a case so not a big deal either way.

- the pop up camera is very nice on the OnePlus to maximize screen space and give you that bit of reassurance re: privacy, the Samsung will face-unlock faster and, while I was skeptical, it's true that you never really notice the tiny camera cutout even while watching videos

Things the OnePlus 7 Pro does better:

- I really, really miss the ring / vibrate / silent toggle switch. Most underrated feature on OnePlus phones. 

- Night mode shots are definitively better. Much better detail and sharpness, Samsung's are a blurry mess (but more accurate colors).

- fingerprint sensor is more reliable on the OnePlus. I do the trick where I train one finger multiple times and the OnePlus is again definitively better. To be fair, I used to have problems with the OnePlus and retrained my print several times but over the last 6 months or so it was flawless, worked as well as one would ever hope for. Maybe I need to keep retraining the Samsung and it will get to that point.

- faster charging on the OnePlus. I bought the 25 watt charger for the Samsung and it's not as fast as the OnePlus warp charge. This is another feature I really miss.

Overall, they are very very close. I wanted to try a real flagship and, if only because of the cameras, I would say that the Samsung is the ""better"" phone. My ideal phone would by a 7 Pro with the Samsung zoom cameras, screen, and battery, and at a price point somewhere between the two devices. Is the Samsung worth 2x the price? I don't think so but it's nice. I'm waiting for the s-pen pro later this year and that will probably help the Samsung's value proposition.

2018-04-17,1523987548,Nokia 7 Plus from an iPhone users perspective (Nokia 7 Plus vs. iPhone 7 Plus),"I have now been playing with my new Nokia 7 Plus for 24 hours and I'm ready to share my initial impressions.

Some background: I have had many Androids before for eg. Galaxy S6 and htc One M7 so I am not new to Android. In the summer of 2017 I switched to an iPhone 6s plus and later to an iPhone 7 plus.

Battery:

The battery life on the Nokia is freaking sick and I also missed having quick charging. 7 hours sot.

Build:

Build on the Nokia is what I would describe different. I don't think there is a phone out there with a similar design than this. Comparing to the iPhone both phones are about the same size but the Nokia fits a 6 inch screen which is awesome.

Camera:

I feel like the camera is pretty much an all around downgrade from the iPhone. It's not bad but it isn't really amazing either. 

Performance:

It's pretty good. No hiccups or an problems in normal use but it was lagging a bit was when the phone was updating all the apps.

What I miss from the iPhone:

I miss the taptic engine a lot and I'm really dissapointed that no Android oems have one that comes close (lg v30 has a much better than the rest though). Believe it not: 3D touch, even though it seems like a gimmick it's very useful when writing on your phone: if you misspell a word you can force touch the keyboard and get precisly to the spot where you missspelled. I also miss the animations a bit: stuff feels more fluid on the iPhone but in contrast stuff feels faster on the Nokia. I also ofcourse miss the ip rating and stereo speakers.

Edit: just did a side by side test of the speakers and the iPhone's are definitely better but not by a huge margin. The Nokia lacks bass as do most phone speakers but It's not the worst one I have tried.

All in all the Nokia feels mostly like a downgrade but I wasn't expecting an upgrade either. I bought this because I want to support Nokia.",Android,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8cyj3v/nokia_7_plus_from_an_iphone_users_perspective/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_ios,,,,,,,,

2021-12-20,1640023273,The next front in Google's war on fragmentation is virtualization. Here's what Google plans to do about it for the Android 13 release.,"Ah, fragmentation: a word that has tainted the Android platform since its inception. The way Google architected and licensed Android was designed to promote early adoption by OEMs, but those early design choices led to years of accrued technical debt that require major technical undertakings to address. Slowly but surely, Google is clawing back control over Android to address fragmentation. First, it addressed the core Android framework with Project Treble and the Generic System Image (GSI). Then it targeted core Android system components with Project Mainline. More recently, it tackled kernel fragmentation with the Generic Kernel Image (GKI). The next front in Googles multi-year war on fragmentation is virtualization.  

Virtualization on Android is a topic that you wont find much discussion on because its esoteric and the work is quietly ongoing, but if youve [followed my work](https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mishaalrahman), youll know that it doesnt matter how niche it isif its Android-related, its right up my alley. Thats why this post is dedicated to virtualization on Android and what Google plans to do with it.  

##Bringing KVM to Android  

Virtualization on Android today is the Wild West of fragmentation, according to Will Deacon on the Android Systems team. This is because [hypervisors](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor) may or may not be present on a device, and when they are, theyre often not even used for their intended purpose, which is to run an operating system in a virtual machine! Instead, theyre used for things like enhancing the security of the kernel ([or at least *trying to*](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/02/mitigations-are-attack-surface-too.html)) and running miscellaneous code (such as third-party code for DRM, cryptography, and other closed-source binaries) outside of the Android OS.  

To understand why the latter is particularly problematic, consider that in the [Armv8/v9 exception model](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102412/0102/Privilege-and-Exception-levels), the hypervisor runs at exception level 2 (EL2). In Arms nomenclature, the higher the number, the higher the privilege level, which means that code running at EL0 (eg. userspace applications) is least privileged, code running at EL1 (eg. the Android OS and Linux kernel) is more privileged, and so on. Thus, a lot of opaque third-party binary blobs run with higher privileges than even the OS and kernel! This is harmful for security, as it increases the attack surface of privileged code that can be exploited, as code running at a higher EL can access all the registers of the lower levels.  

[*Armv8/v9 exception levels. Credits: Arm*](https://imgur.com/KOEIA5N)  

In order to both de-privilege this third-party code and isolate that code from Android and other third-party programs, Google is working to bring a common hypervisor solution on top of which a virtual machine running at the same privilege level as the OS and the kernel will execute that code. There exists a mature kernel virtualization mechanism called KVM which is already supported by Linux, so naturally Google is choosing to deploy it as the common hypervisor. And thanks to Googles ongoing efforts to reduce kernel fragmentation, KVM can be enabled on a broad spectrum of Android devices shipping a recent version of the GKI.  

(Sidenote: Google is actually [extending KVM with additional security features](https://lwn.net/Articles/837552/) and calling it pKVM, or protected KVM. pKVM is designed to enable data confidentiality in a virtual machine, even if the OS is compromised. The implementation is available in the [mainline](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+log/refs/heads/android-mainline/arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/nvhe/pkvm.c), [android13-5.10](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+log/refs/heads/android13-5.10/arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/nvhe/pkvm.c), and [android13-5.15](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+log/refs/heads/android13-5.15/arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/nvhe/pkvm.c) Android Common Kernel branches.)  

To manage these virtual machines, Google is [porting crosvm](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/refs/heads/master/virtualizationservice/src/crosvm.rs), the Rust-based Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) used to run Linux apps on Chrome OS, to Android, and it will be delivered to devices through a new Mainline module called [Virtualization](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/) (com.android.virt). Currently, no Android devices on the market ship with the Virtualization module  not even Googles own Pixel 6  but this is set to change with the upcoming Android 13 release. In fact, Google is currently testing its new virtualization tools on the Pixel 6; if you build AOSP with the target [aosp_oriole_pkvm](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:device/google/raviole/aosp_oriole_pkvm.mk;bpv=0), youll find that com.android.virt [will be automatically inherited](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:device/google/gs101/device.mk;l=1084?q=%22$(call%20inherit-product,%20packages%2Fmodules%2FVirtualization%2Fapex%2Fproduct_packages.mk\)%22). I dont know if Google will enable pKVM on the Pixel 6 series with the Android 13 update, but there is evidence that Google plans for Android 13 to include the first release of the pKVM hypervisor and virtual machine framework.  

(If youre interested in the full history of Googles efforts to bring KVM to Android devices, [watch Will Deacons talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY-u6n75iXc) from last years KVM Forum [or this excellent summary](https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/) by Jake Edge for *LWN*.)  

##Isolated compilation in a virtual machine running CompOS  

With the groundwork laid to run virtual machines on a hypervisor, the question then becomes: What feature(s) does Google itself plan to use this for? Thanks to a series of code changes submitted to the AOSP Gerrit, I have learned about one way that Google plans to demo Androids new virtualization support: isolated compilation.  

Earlier this year, I shared that Google is [working on a new build of Android](https://www.xda-developers.com/microdroid-stripped-down-android-virtual-machines/) called microdroid. Google [describes microdroid](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/HEAD/microdroid/README.md) as a (very) lightweight version of Android that is intended to run on on-device virtual machines and host headless (ie. without a GUI) and native workloads. It is built from the same source code as regular Android, but it is much smaller as it lacks the system_server process, HALs, or a GUI. Microdroid is included in the Virtualization module with its [payload](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/Virtualization/microdroid/payload/README.md?q=payload_config.json) of APEX modules and APKs defined in one JSON file and its partitions and allocated memory defined [in another](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/refs/heads/master/microdroid/microdroid.json).  

Interestingly, it seems that microdroid is just [the default name](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/refs/heads/master/microdroid/payload/config/src/lib.rs#22) of the OS in the VM  it [can be configured to be called something else](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/refs/heads/master/microdroid/payload/config/src/lib.rs#46). This is what I believe CompOS is  an instance of microdroid thats dedicated to performing isolated compilation. (CompOS [is short for Compilation OS,](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/34e18e92f48c174d8953bea0362caf6700e56897/compos/tests/java/android/compos/test/ComposTestCase.java#103) in case youre wondering.)  

You may be wondering at this point what isolated compilation means. [According to Google](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/Virtualization/compos/service/java/com/android/server/compos/IsolatedCompilationService.java?q=IsolatedCompilationService), isolated compilation is the compilation of boot and system_server classpath JARs in a protected VM. When [configuring the system ROM](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/configure#system_rom), device makers typically ship precompiled code for core services like system_server and other classes that zygote initializes on startup. Whenever the Android Runtime (ART) is updated, which can now happen out-of-band as it was [made a Mainline module in Android 12](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-android-runtime-art-mainline-module-android-12/), its possible that compilation artifacts for boot class path extensions and system_server need to be regenerated using the [odrefresh](https://android.googlesource.com/platform//art/+/master/odrefresh) tool (which is why ART APEX updates [sometimes show a progress bar](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-play-system-update-percent-progress/) during boot up). In Android 12, this all happens on the host OS because theres no virtualization support, but in Android 13, this [could happen in CompOS.](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/b2cc79e1e0c8d442a108c2d28949a2ba89ab9c74)  

To be perfectly honest, I am not entirely sure why its advantageous to move this compilation to an isolated VM, but Ive heard a few theories. First, moving this functionality to a VM makes the process overall more secure. Any exploits during the process would need to chain into an exploit of the hypervisor to escape the VM and access data in the host OS. Keep in mind that many parts of the virtual machine framework are written in Rust, a programming language designed with the security of memory management in mind, so this is not trivial to do. Second, a compromised system_server process could be used to accept modified OAT files. By running dex2oat in a VM thats verified by the hypervisor, the compiled OAT file can be cryptographically verified. Those are just theories, though. Only Google knows the exact reason behind this feature, but Im not privy to the internal discussions that led to the development of CompOS.  

Isolated compilation doesnt sound like a particularly interesting use of virtualization on Android, but its most likely not the only use case that Google is working on. It just happens to be the one use case thats developed mostly in public. There are a number of other things that Google can do with a virtualized Android build, but well have to wait for the release of Android 13 to find out what those are. In the meantime, if youre interested in playing with virtualization on Android yourself, Google has a guide on how to [get started with protected virtual machines](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/HEAD/docs/getting_started/index.md) and [microdroid](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Virtualization/+/HEAD/microdroid/README.md).

2012-06-12,1339544561,"An (extremely) in-depth review of the HTC One X, and why I returned it.","Why I returned my HTC One X for my iPhone 4 with a cracked screen:  An in depth, hopefully unbiased look into my experiences with one of the top Android phones on the market today.

First let me preface this with some history regarding my smart phone use.  I have been with iPhone/ iOS since the launch of the very first iPhone on June 29th, 2007.  I remember jail breaking the iPhone on 1.1.4, installing ""apps"" before the app store even existed, and sticking through the software updates until nearly every quirk had been remedied.  I kept that $600 phone for nearly four years, until a new love struck my eye; the iPhone 4.  I purchased the iPhone 4, and it is still my current every day phone.  In the five or so years that I have been using iOS I never really considered switching to anything else.  This is not to say I discredit Android, or even Windows mobile for that matter.  I respect any mobile OS/ hardware manufacturers that help push these little mobile devices to be the best they can be.  Last week I fell while riding my skateboard and when I returned home and pulled my iPhone from my front left pocket I notice that the entire front of the device was shattered.  The second I saw my phone in that state ideas began running wildly through my head; was it time to try something new?

Research began.  What is the best Android phone on the market today?  Why?  What are the differences between the software updates, and how each manufacturer provides them?  I learned more about Android in three days than I had failed to learn over the years with my current smartphone.  I went to the AT&amp;T store to try the handsets out, and ultimately I narrowed my decision down to two models; the HTC One X, and the Samsung Galaxy SIII.  Both phones run the newest Android operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich, both had excellent cameras, processors, design and high praised reviews.  When it came down to my final selection, the HTC One X stole the show for me because it looked beautiful.  I am a sucker for industrial design, especially in any product that I will see literally every single day.  I have to enjoy holding it in my hand, I like to appreciate the design and craftsmanship that went into making the product.  While this may not be a requirement on everyone's smartphone checklist, it is ALWAYS something to consider for me.  That being said, if a really ugly phone was THAT much better than some really pretty phone, I am intuitive enough to realize it.

The HTC One X screams perfection&on paper.  Before your hand even touches the device, it looks damn good.  The large, high-resolution screen pops with color, the matte unibody plastic case has nice curves.  Everything blends together seamlessly, making a really sexy looking phone.  What's even deceiving about the industrial design of this phone is that if you just held it for a few minutes, you would still not have a second thought about how well designed it is.  It wasn't until I began using my new phone that I noticed problems with the hardware.  

The first thing that took some time getting used to was the sheer size of the screen, and the device itself.  I found my stubby thumb having trouble reaching the bottom left and top left corners of the screen, and my index finger having issues making it to the sleep/wake button.  It's not the end of the world, but being able to comfortably use your phone with one hand is something I really enjoy.  Obviously this problem may be a non-issue for people with larger hands than me, but my hands are by no means tiny.  The second thing I discovered is that I use the physical ""home"" button on my iPhone A LOT.  Not having that button nice and close to my thumb to wake the phone drove me crazy, especially since it is such a pain for my index finger to reach the sleep/ wake button.  Also making this task that much more unenjoyable is the fact that the sleep/ wake button is positioned on a downward slope toward the screen.  You have to curl your finger tip up and over the lip (more on this lip later) of the phone in order to press the button down.  I found myself frustratingly using two hands to perform every day functions, and it wasn't just because I wasn't used to phone, it was because I simply couldn't do them comfortably and/ or safely with one hand.  And as for that lip, mentioned above&it drove my crazy.  The entire side of the phone is a seam where the front and the back meet, in a sharp angle.  When you hold the phone on its sides it presses into your fingers. At first it's not so bad, but with time it will literally make your fingers hurt.  I had to keep repositioning my fingers to stay comfortable while holding it.

The next issue that I had with hardware was the volume buttons.  The are so recessed in to the housing of the phone that you cannot tell when your fingers are on them, let alone if you are on the up or down button.  Also these buttons seem to make a shaky, loose plastic sound when you jiggle the phone.  Not the end of the world, but come on, make the buttons solid and easy to find/ press.  There's only three physical buttons, just get them right.  The last thing that irked me was the camera positioning.  The camera juts out from the back center of the phone, making it super easy to scratch.  That wasn't my biggest concern though, but rather that the camera provided an unstable base for the phone to rest.  I do a lot of my smart phone use with the phone laying flat on its back on a desk.  The camera made this super annoying, wobbling all about whenever I pressed towards the sides.  Is it really necessary to make the camera stick out like that?  And with such a large, protruding camera lens, one would imagine that the camera MUST be amazing&right?  Not so much.

I read some amazing things about the camera on the HTC One X.  It's amazing, it's fast, it can shoot rapidly, and even while shooting video.  I was underwhelmed.  It is by no means a BAD camera for any smartphone, I just did not find the photo quality better than the photos that my two year old iPhone 4 shoots.  The rapid shot was neat, but most of the photos in the bunch ended up unusable anyway.  The video looked ok, but both photo and video was grainy.  The video was incredibly shaky, and the camera just looked bad in low light in general.  The front camera was acceptable, and one of the few things that I actually found improved on the HTC over the iPhone.  Another area where this held true was the screen.  Another super hyped aspect of the HTC One X that was outdone by the two year old iPhone.  Once again, the screen is REALLY nice, but it was simply not as good. Another area where the HTC One X could improve is not only its battery life, but its battery charging time.  I got less battery life in daily use on the HTC than I did on the iPhone.  I also found the HTC to take almost three times as long to fully charge.  This adds up to huge headaches.  Also the charger hooks into the side of the phone, and that's a little strange to me. 

Holy cow, that is just hardware.  Let's talk about Android/ HTC Sense.  What a weird new world for me.  I came in with high hopes, somehow believing every comment I see on Gizmodo/ Engadget that Android is better, more sophisticated, open source, more customizable, blah, blah, etc.  I really wanted to love this OS, and I approached it as best I could.  I knew things would be different, and I didn't want that to let me get in the way of a true opinion.  It didn't take long before I noticed some pretty damn near crippling issues.  

Multi-tasking.  Android has had it since forever, and according to everyone on the internet, it is way better than anything iOS could ever accomplish.  While I can't speak for ""true"" Android here, I can say that HTC really messed this up.  Basically HTC runs a skin over Android, called Sense, and it changes a select few things (some apps, the general look, and some functions).  For the most part Sense looks and behaves fine, but it completely destroys multi-tasking.  What Sense does is eliminate apps to make room for more ram.  A prime example of this sucking is when I'm browsing reddit and I'm 5 pages down when I get a text.  I jump over, read the text and reply, and then jump back to reedit through the (clunky) sense app switcher.  Of course the reedit app reloads as if I just launched it, starting at the very top of the first page.  This happens with EVERYTHING.  Every single app that I used was subject to this flaw, and to be blunt it sucked.  Not only that, but the app switcher itself is in no way close to being as useable as that on iOS.  When you enter the app switcher, it shows you a screenshot of one app at a time, and you must flick through to find the one you want.  You can't even see what apps are before or after your current position until you thumb your way over to them.  What a waste of time; I should be able to see at least see two, three, or more recent apps at once.  Also keep in mind that this switcher is Sense specific, and I have seen it looking better on a Galaxy Nexus and SIII.

I have a very fortunate role with my company where I get to play with all the new gadgets... particularly cell phones.


Something I've wondered, particularly on Reddit- why is HTC the bastard child of Androids (besides the Pantech value Android)? Motorola Mobility (Google) and Samsung devices are always the top sellers and get the most hype... but I just can't put my finger on why. 


HTC has delivered a solid smart phone for as long as I've worked with them. The first one I've owned and used was the Audiovox/HTC SMT 5600 built on Windows Mobile 2003. Even back then the operating system wasn't quirky and the battery was one of the best in the industry. More than half a decade later they are still putting out an excellent product. Even when they lost the AMOLED screen due to shortages their replacement SLCD screen was and is still better than anything a new Motorola has. The camera and screen combination presents pictures almost as well as an iPhone does.


Just comparing hardware specs the other brands may *sell* their products better, but HTC does very well with what they have.


Then, the UI- HTC Sense is way more logical than the other flavors. It gives you useful widgets, nice picture adjustments and effects, and an intuitive menu system.


So I just don't get it, why does HTC just not get any love? What did they do wrong that left a bad taste in everyone's mouth that I was just completely unconscience to?


Was it the Thunderbolt? Yeah, it had connection issues but that was more of Verizon's fault than the phone... and yeah the battery wasn't great but the phone was pulling network speeds that were second to none on a smartphone.


So tell me Redditors, why aren't people excited about HTC?

All generations of Apple iPhone,Verizon and AT&amp;T

* They missed some really cool big features like Hardware Accelerated 2D for phones, WiFi Direct for reliable/fast/secure device interactions without internet, and using NFC for establishing bluetooth connections and sending large pieces of data.

* This is the first official release of USB Host on mobile phones. A major operating system now allows conventional USB accessories to plug into the phone (cameras, hard drives, etc). In my opinion, this is a milestone for mobile computing... why wasn't there any mention or demo of it?

* ICS supports tilting/hovering styluses, mice, joysticks, and gamepads.

* Ambient Temperature and Relative humidity sensors are now supported in ICS, and there was no mention of it.

* They should have mentioned that Minecraft didn't need to be modified for the NFC demo... the market link sharing is the default action supported by all existing applications.

* Accessories? The pin connector on the Galaxy Nexus is nice, but it'd be nice to see what they have designed to hook up to it.

* Still no task integration into Android? I don't know what Google is thinking. The desktop calendar has this functionality but it's not very useful to me if I need to load a web app to use it on the phone.

* They made no mention of when exactly we would be getting the devices or the firmware, and we don't know what carriers and what regions.

I will donate my MIPS tablet to any volunteer offering to conduct forensics.

I posted this thread in the morning. By mid afternoon, tablet #2 was just stolen from my locked room. Nothing else was stolen such as money. Another forensics circumvented! The theft answers the question of this thread. Tablet was interdicted FedEx enroute and GSM implanted. Not a chinese backdoor.

I wish MIPS tablets were sold at local retail stores that I can purchase from in person. I decided not to purchase a third MIPS tablet because the battery is nonremovable and I don't know whether it has RFID. To prevent Wake on GSM, it would need to be stored it in a bulky faraday bag.

The next question that needs answering is whether my laptops were implanted with GSM and infected with badBIOS and other firmware rootkits when they were interdicted. I had suspected FM radio transceiver/beacon implants.

Many of the linux /var/logs I was denied permission to read even though I had logged into the graphical desktop as root. A few of the /var/logs were of unknown file type. The type was unknown to the file manager. See my threads on Fedora, Privatix and PCLinuxOS FullMonty. Had the firmware rootkits not tampered with the /var/logs, GSM may have been reported in the logs.

Fortunately, aLogcat had file permissions to read some of the android logs. Fortunately, aLogcat did not require root to be installed. The snippets of the alogcats posted in this thread were not reported by aLogcat until after destroying the chip I had guessed was the gryometer or accerometer. Whether this was the cause of aLogcat's more detailed reporting or a coincidence, I do not know.

2021-01-18,1610965245,How Law Enforcement Gets Around Your Smartphone's Encryption,"This recently released [research paper: Data Security on Mobile Devices: Current State of the Art, Open Problems, and Proposed Solutions](https://securephones.io/main.html) by [Matthew Green and his team](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1341746171220537344.html) which is also covered by [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-encryption-law-enforcement-tools/) talks about design flaw in data encryption of android and iOS. Wired brushes off most of the technical details and the paper didn't cover [android's File Based Encryption](https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based) very well which I think needs some clarity on it. The paper draws the correct conclusion though and what should be improved in successor android versions.

----------

In android 7+, `/data` partition is encrypted by **File Based Encryption** (FBE) on first boot by default. FBE keys are generated in **hardware-backed keystore**. FBE keys are encrypted in keystore with the key derived from user's screen lock password. So unless you enter correct password, keystore cannot decrypt FBE keys. When you reboot your device, it is in **Before First Unlock** (BFU) state which means the user has yet to unlock screen first time since reboot. In this state, if someone calls you or messages you, their name won't show up unless you unlock your screen. That's because the device is waiting for your lock screen password which is to be used to decrypt FBE keys and FBE keys are encrypting your contact names.

Once you unlock your screen first time since reboot, it goes to **After First Unlock** (AFU) state which means the user has unlocked the device first time since reboot. Further locking and unlocking won't revert the state unless you reboot again which throws you back on BFU.

----------

**Temporary per-boot key**: In AFU state, FBE keys are decrypted by the keystore and are immediately re-encrypted again by a temporary per-boot key. Per-boot key is generated &amp; stored by keystore and its validity is until next reboot. Encrypted FBE keys blob is then **cached** in `/system/vold`. This ensures that FBE keys are never in plain text when cached by the OS.

----------

As FBE keys are cached though encrypted, you can now use your biometric to unlock screen and kernel can request keystore to decrypt FBE keys on demand means whenever an application wants to read and write, kernel will load FBE keys in memory and they will remain in memory until next reboot. That's because running apps need them for read and write even if you lock your screen. E.g. To display contacts on lock screen, sharing live location, listening to music, sync services, etc. they need those keys in memory else they won't work on locked screen.

This opens a security hole. Users don't often reboot their devices for months so it is in AFU state. The intruder and law enforcement can extract those keys from memory to decrypt sensitive data of running applications without knowing your screen lock. **This procedure requires carefully exposing the SoC without disconnecting the battery.**

----------

iOS encrypts personal data with keys that are evicted from memory 10 seconds after locking the screen. When it is in BFU state, iPhone needs password to derive a **Class key**. At this time, biometric won't work. When it is in AFU state, it caches **Class key** in Secure Enclave. Now user can use biometric and cached Class key is used to re-derive those evicted keys again when screen is locked and unlocked.

----------

This keys eviction feature is what android also needs otherwise if the intruder is able to decrypt whole `/data` partition, he can own that data in it or if he wants to own the stolen device and doesn't care about the data, he could be able to set `enable` bit for OEM unlocking. Thent he can go to bootloader mode and unlock the bootloader.

&gt; In most cases, FBE keys also undergo an additional key derivation step in the kernel in order to generate the subkeys actually used to do the encryption, for example per-file or per-mode keys.

If FBE keys are compromised, so will sub-keys so this derivation step doesn't add much protection even if sub-keys are evicted in newer versions. Android should keep FBE key bundle in keystore itself and load sub-keys in memory some of which can be evicted after screen lock.

Law enforcement can just force your fingerprint to unlock your device and can lie about that in court that it was already unlocked at the time of arrest so no kind of device security can stop them. Locks deter only honest people.

----------

Most common questions:

1. Why biometric doesn't work after reboot?

- After reboot, the device is in BFU state and waiting for you to enter PIN/password which can be used to derive key that decrypts FBE keys.

2. How does biometric decrypt FBE keys again when the user locks and unlocks the screen second time (or Nth time)?

- It doesn't. FBE keys were already decrypted by the keystore when the screen was unlocked first time since reboot (They are re-encrypted by a different key and cached, see temporary per-boot key section). When you unlock using biometric, keystore lets the OS know that the user is verified and should be allowed access. This is enforced by SELinux policy.

3. I forgot my PIN/password, why do I need to factory reset the device to use my phone? That would erase all my data.

- Your PIN/password is used to derive key that encrypts and decrypts FBE keys as explained in the post. If you have forgotten your PIN/password, your data cannot be decrypted anyway so even if there was a feature to reset PIN without factory reset, it would be useless. Instead it would allow thieves to reset PIN and reuse your device.

4. If data partition is not decrypted until you enter your password, where does the phone store things like language, wallpaper, wifi logins, Bluetooth pairings that are visible right after the phone boots?

- I intentionally left out this part that FBE has 2 types of storage:

  Device Encrypted Storage: This is directly encrypted by keystore and do not require your password for decryption.

  Credentials Encrypted Storage: This is encrypted with a key derived from your password.

  The most basic functionalities are encrypted under device encrypted storage so that your phone will be still usable for taking calls and receiving messages even if you don't unlock it.

5. **While in lockdown mode, my contact names are still showing up on call**

- I checked in settings and it says that it **turns off smart lock, fingerprint and notifications on lock screen**. So it doesn't clear keys in memory probably because Google wants to ensure usability of background apps like listening to music. This means it may disable biometric for law enforcement but won't put your phone back in BFU state.

  Android apps process cycle isn't designed to adapt if FBE keys are suddenly cleared from memory without letting the apps know. It would instantly crash most of the system apps and services because of I/O error when they couldn't find keys. In iOS, apps are alerted that the user has locked the device.

6. Why can't biometric be used as a key to decrypt FBE keys?

- Because you always put your finger slightly differently on the sensor. Keystore approves authentication if enough of the mathematical values match. To use something as a key or to derive a key from something, you need something that doesn't change and always produces the same output.

7. What about multi-user phones? I have a dummy profile set up and if I never unlocked my main profile after reboot I can't see it's files from it.  But if I have unlocked previously I see them.

- If multi-user profiles are set up, keys can be recovered for currently running user only. When you switch user, keys for earlier user are cleared from memory. That's another good way to stay safe without rebooting the device.

8. Wait, why is only `/data` partiton encrypted, but system partitons are not?

- You don't need encryption for system partitions. Other partitions are already public images. What you need is their integrity protection. All system partitions are protected by [android verified boot 2.0](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/avb/+/master/README.md)

2015-06-01,1433179241,"Dear Google, please don't give flashlight apps my e-mail address in Android M","**tl;dr** According to the limited information we have now, *all apps* written for Android M can have access to e-mail addresses of the owner.

---

Now that we've seen the announcements from I/O, we've probably all heard of the migration to *[runtime permissions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM)*, which allow you to be asked for permissions while using the app, as opposed to during installation (a good thing). What you also might've heard is that it now relies on permission [categories](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM&amp;t=150) instead of the more specific permission model that was used in the past.

Alongside this change, apps will be [given more permissions by default](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/runtime-permissions.html), even without accepting any permission categories on Android M. One of the permissions that currently [appears to be granted](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-m-preview/core/res/AndroidManifest.xml) by default in Android M is GET_ACCOUNTS, which grants [access to your e-mail address](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2175688) for Google accounts, and even if Google changes this, might still grant access to e-mail addresses belonging to other account types and services. (Thanks to [christop](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9621627) for mentioning this permission.)

**My request to Google:** please don't grant this permission unless the user approves the Contacts category. Please ensure that merely installing the wrong flashlight app, live wallpaper or what-have-you cannot allow my e-mail address to be sent to an organization I've never heard of that is registered in the Seychelles. (Don't forget - full network access comes with all apps in Android M!)

---

*Quit reading here if you're not interested in other issues and vulnerabilities the new model in Android M could cause.*

Aside from e-mail addresses, there are some other permissions I think might be troublesome to automatically grant to apps, and I'm not completely sure yet I've found all of them. I'd like to kindly ask anyone who can to thoroughly review those permissions to ensure that they don't end up as the technical debt that future API levels need to try to fix again, after causing users pain in the mean time.

* READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE isn't used much by the Nexus range, but for many other devices this permission is highly sensitive, containing full device backups, contact backups, and highly sensitive downloads outside of app-specific directories. It was not shown to be one of the new permission categories. How does Android M deal with it? Might it be time to switch away from FAT32 to ext4 to allow for permissions to apply to it?

* CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is automatically granted and can allow apps to turn on mobile data (and WiFi). This can cost money to the millions of users who have exceeded their data plans or who are on prepaid plans. Suggested fix: a System Settings permission category.

* READ_PHONE_STATE is part of the Phone category, but used to be requested by developers frequently to detect *whether* there was an incoming call so that app audio could be muted. Please ensure that apps cannot get phone numbers without the Phone category, but that apps can still gracefully deal with incoming calls.

* GET_TASKS  is granted by default but was being deprecated. Please disable it in API23 so that apps cannot peek into the thumbnails of other apps. Information shown to the user may be sensitive and must not be seen by other apps.

* SET_WALLPAPER (and its hints) are granted by default and seem like low-impact permissions, but I'm sure that was initially thought of allowing apps to show notifications as well, until push ads came along. Now that the user can disable notifications for specific apps, apps may be inclined to show ads on the wallpaper instead if they're given this permission for free anyway (including ones prompting for virus scans and nonsense like that). I suggest adding this to a new System Settings permission category.

* WRITE_SETTINGS is granted by default, while it used to be treated as quite sensitive. A System Settings category would fix this.

* SET_TIME_ZONE is granted by default, but should also require System Settings.

* MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is granted by default but allowed for redirecting audio streams, and should require the Microphone permission category. If this is now split off to MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING, consider making that a part of the System Settings category as well, instead of making this functionality impossible for future devices.

* READ_SYNC_SETTINGS, WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS could conceivably leak private details depending on the identity information associated with it. Might make more sense in a System Settings category.

* App names/icons displayed in the permission prompts should match the Play Store name and icon, otherwise apps may be inclined to request permissions as ""Android System"" or something equally serious.

* Contacts is a highly sensitive permission category, especially in conjunction with full network access. In some jurisdictions providing users' personal details such as phone numbers to third parties may even be illegal without the permissions of those contacts, and I think it's frowned upon by many regardless. There should be a way for apps to opt-out of all communication subsystems so that they can be allowed access to sensitive data such as contacts, special files, confidential recordings, etc. ""**Offline apps**"" if you will, which could be a simple label given automatically to all apps that do not request network permissions such as INTERNET, BLUETOOTH etc. This could be the only category whose auto-updates would need to be limited to updates that are also Offline apps. A lack of this feature will pose problems for devices used in high-security environments and could give Android a bad name in the enterprise environment, as nothing could ever be guaranteed to remain private.

2019-12-01,1575223591,Smartphones after 6+ years and other things that manufacturers don't like people to know,"One weekend ago I wanted to test some specific custom phone ROMs out there but in the first stage I was prepared to do (potentially more destructive) tests only on the oldest Android phone I still have - a Samsung Note 3 N9005 from 2013.

So I went ahead and updated it to the latest Samsung stock (Android 5.0 from 2015 - before Samsung switched to 3 years of security updates for the flagships, old stuff but it was needed to be certain the phone has the latest baseband/modem and other separate firmware). Needless to say - security update was ancient and it was open to attacks like WiFi KRACK and probably tons of other newer attacks. Speed was not that great but that was to be expected for a device of that age.

Then I tested with two Android projects that sounded very cool - the very first one was [/e/  (formerly Eelo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/_(operating_system\)), which is based on [LineageOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS) but with certain improvements for privacy and for a digital life where Google does not know everything about you. It was mentioned somehow recently in articles like [this](https://uk.pcmag.com/motorola-moto-z-play-droid/123158/hands-on-with-e-a-version-of-android-that-ditches-google) or [this](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-e-google-free-pro-privacy-android-clone-is-now-available/) but also discussed [here](https://infosec-handbook.eu/blog/e-foundation-first-look/) and [a response here](https://medium.com/hackernoon/leaving-apple-google-how-is-e-actually-google-free-1ba24e29efb9).

The install was in my experience simple enough (first of the above articles is saying it is not that easy, but perception of easy can be very different) and things started quite nicely, the phone was definitely snappier than with the Samsung stock firmware and all things I tested seemed to work fine. The experience was somehow limited since Google was kept outside it - on purpose.

And then I tried a more exotic project - [HavocOS 3.0](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-3/development/rom-havocos-3-0-t4000767) - a project based on Android 10 AOSP (with credits for LineageOS and a lot other projects) and ""inspired by Google Pixel"". The project has some excellent developers and maintainers - you can see those in the link above.

Installation is a little more complex (since it is an earlier beta and on Android 10 OpenGapps is still a moving target) but in the end things went fine installing BiTGApps as some people in the XDA forum were suggesting.

And this one was the special surprise - a few days back when I was playing with that I did have Android 10 with November 5 patch level on my Pixel 2XL but my (more recent) Note9 was on Android 9 November 1 patch level and the Poco F1 has only got the October 1 patch (also on Android 9). But the Note 3 from 6+ years ago now was also having Android 10 with November 5 patch level just like the Pixel, and a default launcher that was very much like the default Pixel launcher (which I normally replace with Apex Launcher Pro for consistency among all my phones, but on the Note3 I decided to give it a chance).

Anyway - long story short my ""old relict"" phone was now probably snappier than it ever was in the past (newer ART versions probably help) and on the latest security patch available to the public. It is almost as usable as any of my other phones from the signature (and in fairness with 3 GB RAM it is also the closest to the Pixel2XL from all my Android phones, all other Android phones have 6 GB RAM and that shows).

So why all this long story? Well, first of all to point that the level of updates in the normal commercial phones is a matter of commercial choice and not of technical choice - manufacturers try to support phones for the absolutely minimal amount of time they can get away with, and for the people that are not prepared to live unprotected the easy choice is just to upgrade to the latest (usually expensive) phone.

The other reason is to point to the fact that the Samsung Note3 has a removable battery (it is not even the last Note to have that, the Note4 is). And that means that the phone could probably last on open-source Android projects with up-to-date security for as long as I can still find a replacement for the batteries - which unfortunately in itself no longer seems so easy, most of what I could find was inexpensive stuff of dubious quality. But the point remains - good phones could vastly outlast the ""planned obsolescence"" built into them, but in the absence of significant regulation this ""planned obsolescence"" will just continue to creep-in and contribute to the increased amount of technological waste and pollution around us.

I have found preexisiting features in 1980's software invalidating a claim on apple U.S. Patent N 5,946,647 to shut down all android phones
","**(read this but we still need to bust the OTHER bad patent which is the only other one that is being used in this case. I posted about that here http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/n5mbh/help_bust_a_bad_software_patent_that_might_end/)**

(Note I have now emailed this info to google, EFF and HTC and the htc attorney in the case and have gotten email return receipts from HTC head honchos and attorney.)

There is ruling coming down which may invalidate all android phones on the 14th. don't laugh. this kind of rulling already made manufacturers pull out of some european markets. 

http://www.cultofmac.com/133246/apple-could-knock-the-worlds-biggest-android-maker-out-of-the-u-s-tomorrow/

its ridiculous and I sent the following to google today:

I have found preexisiting features in 1980's software invalidating a claim on apple U.S. Patent N 5,946,647 to shut down all android phones

The whole apple claim is infuriating to me because the claim is something that was implemented in at least one common software I used from 1983's called Sidekick from borland.

Furthermore I believe it was a fairly common feature in many programs that read internet mail and messages from bulletin boards.
The 1980's DOS software ""sidekick"" from Borland International could recognize a phone number in text and highlight it and if you clicked on it call that number using your pc's modem.

The software is generally described here:
from [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SideKick[/url]
""Sidekick v1.11c

SideKick was an early Personal Information Manager (PIM) software application by Borland launched in 1983 under Philippe Kahn's leadership. It was notable for being a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which enabled it to load into memory then return the computer to the DOS command prompt, allowing the user to load another application, but still activate SideKick using a hot key combination (by default: Ctrl-Alt). This approach allowed instantaneous task switching in the otherwise-single-tasking DOS operating system. Although a text mode program, its window-based interface echoed that of the Apple Macintosh, and anticipated the eventual look of Microsoft Windows 2.0. It featured a personal calendar, text editor (with WordStar-like command interface), calculator, ASCII chart, and address book/phone dialer. According to the Borland IPO prospectus, SideKick sold more than one million copies in its first three years.""

While that description doesn't cut it i can tell you it could auto recognize phone numbers from text and highlight them and if you clicked them it would dial your modem.


The original sidekick software is available from

(link removed so the site isn't overwhelmed by redditors beofre google can download a copy)

in the zip file you will find the help file called sk.hlp where the previous quote was taken.
you can open that hlp file with a hex editor if nothing else.

In that original copy of the software downloadable online, in the archive is the help file sk.hlp and the following description:

""More..Dialer  takes phone numbers from its own phone di-

rectory or directly from the screen.  You may find

the number with your database program,  and  Side-

kick will use your modem to make the call!

               ""


Additionally in that help file it described how the software used special characters thatnormally appeared in phone numbers to recognize them as phone numbers

""The phone number may contain digits, parentheses,
hyphens,  and spaces, and it must contain either a
parentheses or a hyphen to be recognized.

The number may also contain the following characters
with special meaning""

It relates to the claim cited by apple in

The apple patent ""infringed was filed in 1996"" so this software clearly predates that.



a general discussion of the apple patent is below from

[url]http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/07/these-tables-show-how-android-infringes.html[/url]
U.S. Patent No. 5,946,647
""covers a ""system and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data"". Like most patents, this one consists of multiple claims. In a way, each patent claim is like a patent of its own when it comes to the question of infringement. The ITC judge found that the accused HTC products infringe claims 1, 8, 15 and 19 of that patent. If you see that claim 1 of a given patent is infringed, that means in most cases that the broadest claim in the patent -- or at least one of its broadest few claims -- is infringed. (Those are the kinds of claims that can be as easy to walk around as the Great Wall of China.)

In its complaint, Apple described this patent (which was applied for back in 1996 and which will expire on February 1, 2016) as follows:

   The '647 patent generally relates to a computer-based system and method for detecting structures and performing computer-based actions on the detected structures. In particular, this invention recognizes that computer data may contain structures, for example, phone numbers, post-office addresses, and dates, and performs related actions with that data. The '647 patent accomplishes this by identifying the structure, associating candidate actions to the structures, enabling selections of an action, and automatically performing the selected action on the structure. For instance, the system may receive data that includes a phone number, highlight it for a user, and then, in response to a user's interaction with the highlighted text, offer the user the choice of making a phone call to the number.'

ridiculous!

I submit this for open dissemination and hopes someone in a position to do something about stopping this ridiculous patent claim will file a motion to do it.


disclaimer:
I am not a lawyer.
this is not legal advice.
I am a researcher with some experience in patent research.




I sent this to google to prevent the great harm to the millions of android users that could come from enforcement of this ridiculous patent claim by apple.

viewing apples claims table from
http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/07/these-tables-show-how-android-infringes.html
I beleive this sidekick software invalidates ALL of the ""647"" patent. most of the claims are so generla and ridiculous they would be predated by any computer of the 1980's when combined with recognizing and doing something with a data structure liek a phonenumber which the pc running the sidekick softare did in 1983.

---  

*Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google*

**New York, NY, February 18, 2025**  Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.

Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors  Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.

The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.  said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.**

**Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**

OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).

This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.

Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets  the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.

**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**

OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.

In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.

**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**

OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.

**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**

The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).

**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**

When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).

**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**

The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.

2021-12-06,1638813642,The long road to 64-bit only Android,"Back in 2017, Apple ended support for 32-bit applications with iOS 10.3.2, dropping compatibility with old, unmaintained apps [from the dawn of the smartphone.](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/01/future-ios-release-will-soon-end-support-for-unmaintained-32-bit-apps/) It took the company just four years to transition iOS from 32-bit to 64-bit only software, a remarkably quick turnaround made possible by Apples total control of its hardware, the iOS operating system, and the App Store.  

Google, on the other hand, does not exert the same level of control over the hardware that can run Android or the methods of app distribution, so Android still supports running 32-bit applications to this day. Thats despite the fact that the [Armv8 ISA introduced the AArch64](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2499721/arm-goes-64-bit-with-new-armv8-chip-architecture.html) execution mode back in 2011, Android 5.0 Lollipop [introduced platform-level support](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop#Perf) for 64-bit apps in 2014, and [Google Play mandated](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/64-bit) that apps support 64-bit CPUs in 2019. Android as an OS platform wont deprecate 32-bit support for quite a while, but were finally nearing the point where the first devices will ship with 64-bit only support. Before that happens, though, were about to enter a weird transitional period thanks to the launch of asymmetric 32-bit SoCs from Qualcomm and MediaTek.  

Last week, Qualcomm [announced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17091/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-gen-1-flagship-soc-for-2022-devices/), the companys first system-on-chip to use the [Armv9 ISA](https://www.xda-developers.com/armv9-architecture/). The CPU features one Cortex-X2 core, three Cortex-A710 cores, and four Cortex-A510 cores, but only the three Cortex-A710 cores [support execution of 32-bit applications.](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16693/arm-announces-mobile-armv9-cpu-microarchitectures-cortexx2-cortexa710-cortexa510#:~:text=An%20Armv9%20CPU%20Family%20%E2%80%93%20AArch64%20only%20for%20all%20practical%20purposes*) MediaTeks flagship Dimensity 9000 chipset, which was [announced just three weeks ago](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17070/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9000), has a similar core configuration. That means 2022s flagship smartphones will only use three of their eight CPU cores to execute 32-bit apps.  

This, at first glance, seems problematic given the way CPU affinity works in Linux. As explained in [this *LWN* article](https://lwn.net/Articles/838339/), Linuxs task scheduler was designed to assume that all CPUs can run any given task, albeit at different performance or power consumption levels depending on the specific core chosen for the task. However, the introduction of CPUs with some cores that can execute 32-bit tasks and some that cannot changes the equation; the scheduler distributing tasks to a CPU core incapable of executing that task could be detrimental.   

Fortunately, kernel engineers at Arm and Google were well aware of this impending problem, so late last year [they began work](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arch/20201208132835.6151-1-will@kernel.org/) on a series of patches to support asymmetric 32-bit SoCs, which kernel engineer Will Deacon [hilariously described](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arch/20201208132835.6151-3-will@kernel.org/) as systems built by some crazy folks. These patches [have been picked](https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:asymmetric-32-bit) to the mainline and android12-5.10 Android Common Kernel branches already, so Android devices with the latest chipsets from Qualcomm or MediaTek will almost certainly have this feature. [This document](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arm64/asymmetric-32bit.html) explains in-depth how Linuxs task scheduler will handle the asymmetry if youre interested in more details.  

If youre wondering why SoCs are being productized with a mix of 32/64-bit capable cores in the first place, the reason is that there are still markets where 32-bit apps are being distributed. Over 99% of new and updated apps on Google Play are bundled with a 64-bit APK, thanks to Googles policy update in 2019 that forced developers to distribute 64-bit versions of their apps. However, there are a myriad of app stores in China, each of which have their own set of rules, so there isnt a gatekeeper like Google that can force app developers to recompile their apps. Thanks to an [agreement between the top app stores in China](https://firstxw.com/view/283412.html), though, the distribution of 32-bit apps will be largely phased out next year. With these requirements in place, [the first 64-bit only SoCs are](https://www.xda-developers.com/arm-future-chips-32-bit-2023/) set to be productized in 2023, and thats finally when well see the first Android devices ship without support for 32-bit apps.  

Android itself is also finally ready to support 64-bit only configurations. Android 12 is [the first version of the OS to support 64-bit only builds](https://twitter.com/luca020400/status/1276566566776320001). All Android devices currently on the market run either a 32-bit or 32/64-bit hybrid Android build, but Google aims to eliminate the latter through the use of compatibility requirements. The [latest revision to the CDD](https://blog.esper.io/android-12-compatibility-guide#hardwarereqsforhandhelds) explicitly requires device makers to build 32-bit Android for low RAM devices. [The goal](https://mobile.twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1419767542978129923) is to reduce the types of Android builds to two  Android 32-bit only and Android 64-bit only  to reduce fragmentation until 32-bit support can be fully deprecated years from now.  

Once Androids 32-to-64-bit transition is finally complete, though, some iconic apps will unfortunately be retired from use, as was the case when iOS dropped 32-bit support. Apps, especially older games that havent been recompiled, will be lost to history without emulation, which is unfortunate because Android is as important to the history of the smartphone as iOS. Data preservationists will surely maintain backups of old Android apps, though, and its much easier to run older versions of Android than it is iOS, so things arent as bad as they seem.  

The benefits of 64-bit only Android wont be visible to most users, but theyll make a big difference to device makers. One of the primary benefits is improved security, as a higher available address space allows for better address space layout randomization (ASLR) and enables other features like memory tagging extension (MTE), pointer authentication (PAC), and branch target identification (BTI). Other benefits include better performance and reduced costs from not having to support multiple ABIs.

2016-01-03,1451796045,PSA: One of the biggest battery life killers is the cellphone radio. Many phones allow you to disable LTE and save battery life.,"Hi /r/android!

I've seen a lot of posts recently about battery life complaints. Have you noticed how different people with the same model phones have such differing battery life? Well, cellphone signal could be to blame. I'm sure many times you've seen reviews and specifications listing different talk time and battery life with 2G, 3G, 4G and WiFi. But, I bet a good number don't really pay much attention to it. Well, it's good to understand what's going on in your phone and how you can change things to increase you battery life.

*Warning: Words*

Modern smartphones have different radio transceivers in the phone. For the sake of simplicity, I will strictly be talking about 3GPP/GSM technologies but 3GPP2/CDMA isn't much different. Because phones run on battery, not all the transceivers run at the same time. For cellular communication, GSM phones use 3 different frequencies with varying technologies. At the lowest scale, you gave GSM/GPRS/EDGE. These are technologies from the 2G era and operate on their own range of frequencies. Each phone has it's own 2G transceiver and most UIs label them as GSM bands. 

Next comes WCDMA, which started the 3G era with UTMS. This subsequently branched to HSPA. Both of these use the same bands and transceiver. HSPA+ was created and is actually pretty fast and is labelled as 3.5G. In fact, some providers called HSPA+ 4G since it can reach theoretical speeds of 168mbps. It isn't uncommon for providers to offer 42mbps for HSPA+. 

Now, the latest is LTE, which, we call ""real"" 4G. Again, this technology runs on it's own transceiver and frequencies. 

*End Warning:*

Now that we've gone through the frequencies and bands, let's talk about the radio/modem. In your phone, there's a piece of hardware that manipulates which transceivers gets turned on and off, what band/frequency they operate on, and which to send data over. Normally, the modem will try to use the fastest technology first, and it can't, falls back to the previous generation. Sometimes you can operate two frequencies at the same time. For example, some phones have LTE, but not VoLTE (Voice over LTE). This means, if you're on LTE and you make a call, HSPA is being used for Voice communication. Also, sometimes, a device will do a handover to another tower or frequency, when signal starts dropping, for example, if you're in a car and on the phone.

But the problem lies in how and when phones decide to disable transceivers. If you have a weak signal, **your phone will increase the power of the transceiver to maintain the connection.** Yes, this means a phone with terrible signal will die a lot faster than a phone with great signal. Because LTE is still a developing technology, sometimes it's better to let your phone run on HSPA because your phone will require less power to run.

As far as I've seen, modems do not prioritize power usage. They prioritize latest generation over power consumption. In my stucco over brick house, my phone will have 0-1 bars on LTE, destroying the battery life, despite HSPA getting 4-5 bars. 

**Android does not intelligently manage cellular band selection.** All decisions are done by the modem chip logic, and they mostly care about showing you that nice LTE/4G symbol over saving your battery.  Generally speaking, each new generation uses more power than the last under similar signal strength.

Luckily, though Android isn't smart enough to do it for you, you can manage this manually. Stock Android has the ability to change cellular bands in Mobile Networks in Settings. So, if you are not in the active process of downloading something time critical, you might consider switching to 3G or even 2G. 

I have looked into it and it may be possible to write an app that can do this for you. An example piece of logic would be to switch to 2G or 3G mode when connected to WiFi and switch back when a call or MMS gets received.

This recently came to my attention when I decommissioned my Note 4. Normally, the phone wouldn't last for more than 18 hours without charging. Once I took out the sim card, the cellular radio disabled. It lasted days without dying with WiFi on. I'm sure many of you have had similar experiences with Airplane mode, which would effectively do the same thing.

Well, this is something I wanted to share with you guys. I hope app developers and manufacturers take stuff like this into account in the future and hopefully we can see some cool algorithms to save battery life.

I just wanted to note that some phones (like Samsung) require you to access special menus to toggle the radios.

**Edit: More words to read!!!**

I found a [research paper](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~lierranli/coms6998-7Spring2014/papers/rrclte_mobisys2012.pdf) with join cooperation between researches from AT&amp;T Research Labs and University of Michigan from 2012. While technology does improve and some information on the paper may be outdated, I'd like to highlight this excerpt: 

&gt;Based on these observations, LTE is less energy efficient during
idle state and for transferring smaller amount of data. For example,
if only one packet is transferred, the energy usage considering
both promotion and tail energy for LTE, 3G and WiFi is 12.76J,
7.38J and 0.04J, respectively. One possible reason for LTEs higher
power states is that devices must incorporate multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) to support LTE network, e.g., the test device
we use has 1 transmit antenna and 2 receive antennas, which
contributes to higher power consumption.

Idling seems to be better on 3G than on LTE, but do note that downloading something faster on LTE may work better than downloading on 3G. For example, if it takes you 60 minutes to download something on 3G, but 30 minutes on LTE, that means your LTE modem will be idle for a good 30 minutes while 3G would burn through the full 60 minutes. Also signal strength is also a major factor. 

What I didn't know was how much more power efficient WiFi is versus cellular technologies. This means users on Project Fi would probably get away with using Airplane Mode + WiFi and have ridiculous battery life. Maybe a nice Tasker script could automate when the Airplane Mode toggles based on lack of WiFi signal.

**Edit: Pretty pictures, colors, and graphs:

http://networks.nokia.com/system/files/document/lte_measurements_final.pdf

Note, the conclusion didn't include LTE's DRX modes which improves idling since it's an older document (but the AT&amp;T one does).

My family had a few new Android phones in recent weeks and I noticed that VoLTE/VoWiFi works on  some and not on others. All of them are on Dutch network KPN. The situation is: 

\- Nokia G20 - Android One, Android 11 (works) 

\- Samsung A02 - Android 10  (works)

\- Pixel 4a - Android 11  (doesn't work) 

\- Motorola Moto G Pro - Android One, Android 11 (doesn't work) 

I work in telecom and I asked around on LinkedIn why it doesn't work. I found that the situation is a massive mess and will hurt the ability of people to dial emergency service. In addition it is a situation that's very anti-competitive. Smaller operators, MVNOs, end-users are all suffering from this anti-competitive behaviour. 

The big bad guys are handset manufacturers (particularly Apple and Samsung), SoC vendors, telcos, network gear makers and even the AOSP. The whole list of who and why I wrote up in the blog below.

Last week I asked this question on Linkedin.

*Does anyone know how telcos certify mobile devices? VoLTE and VoWiFi have been standardized* *for a few years now, yet it is hit and miss whether a new phone will have this activated. What is this gap between standard and implementation? I have some phones on KPN where a Samsung A02 and an Android One Nokia G20 will work, but Pixel 4a and Moto G pro who are also Android One wont.

We could do with input from handset makers, Android developers, regulators etc.

To paraphrase the debate:

## VoLTE and VoWiFi is a mess and it needs (the threat of) regulators to sort it out

and to add, now that 2G and 3G circuit switched voice is meeting its end of life on mobile networks, this might well mean that many phones wont be able to call 112 in a few years.

The reason VoLTE and VoWifi often dont work is (my paraphrasing and opinions):

1. it isnt (just) *telcos* who play a role in determining whether a user can use VoLTE and VoWifi. Yes they have to test, so there may be bottlenecks there, but it isnt just them not willing to work together. (My working hypothesis was to blame telcos),

2. its the *handset makers* (Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Motorola) who should install and configure settings and whitelist telcos and MVNOs but often cant be bothered. Apple is a well known bad boy also for eSIM integration (hadnt thought they were so reluctant to get stuff working),

3. The *System on a Chip vendors* (Qualcomm, Mediatek etc.) often deliver the settings with their chip and the smaller vendors just use that list, forgetting and omitting MVNOs or anybody else

4. *Operating systems* dont play a big enough role MVNOs and Telcos can register their APN data in the Android Open Source Project, but its a crapshoot whether it will end up in a device. This doesnt appear to be the necessary data for VoWifi or VoLTE, but it shows that just registering data at a location isnt enough.

5. the *GSMA* (A mobile telco lobby organisation who dont allow MVNOs to be a member), maintain the NSX database with operator settings including for VoLTE and VoWiFi, which handset makers could use but dont. Apple and Samsung flat out refuse. Because they cant be bothered. MVNOs appear to be excluded. (A lobby club guarding the implementation of standards doesnt seem right)

6. *Network platform vendors* have conflicting interpretations of standards. The VoLTE and VoWifi implementations of network vendors appear to be not fully standardized either, so this may cause implementation issues. Your phone may work with an Ericsson network, but not with a Huawei or Nokia network.

7. the *3GPP* was only mentioned as the organisation that chose the wrong VoLTE implementation (out of six proposals?) Other than that the 3GPP appears to play no role here.. (Weird in my opinion that we have a global standard, that no one agrees on, rough consensus and running code is not a thing here it seems.) The story I heard was that everybody kind of forgot to standardize VoLTE, because they thought another 3GPP working group would do it. But you know, that is just as good as 6 ideas and the wrong one chosen.

8. *Regulators* arent involved (enough). It used to be that a GSM phone could make a call anywhere. For Europe this was the whole idea behind the Groupe Speciale Mobile in the eighties; interoperability. That is dead now and regulators arent involved in making sure it is true for VoLTE and other mobile communication standards, such as eSIMs. (Maybe someone at the European Commission or Berec should have a look?)

9. *Telephony is old* and done the way it was developed in the eighties. Traditional switched 2G/3G voice is to be phased out. There is no guarantee the industry will fix its problems and this means there is no guarantee consumers will be able to call 112/911 and other E.164 telephone number based services in the future. There is no guarantee an off the shelf phone will work with VoLTE or VoWiFi. The result will be that consumers will use Whatsapp Voice and others even more for personal calls, but it will leave governments and businesses with a huge gap in their connectivity strategy

10. *Competition* is in no ones interest. The lack of standardization and implementation hurts competition in the market. MVNOs, smaller niche handset makers, M2M-providers all appear to be facing a threat from larger manufacturers, SoC-providers and MNOs, who all are under no obligation to make things work. Only if you control millions of subscriptions and your CEO can make a credible threat to the bottom line of a sales dude at Apple, Samsung, Ericsson, Nokia or Vodafone, KPN and T-Mobile, can you get something to work.

**Conclusion**

It doesnt really hurt anybody importants bottom line too much that VoLTE and VoWiFi dont work. It saves work for handset vendors, SoC vendors, mobile network operators, network gear manufacturers etc. The pain is with MVNOs, consumers, smaller niche manufacturers who have no guarantee they can get their products and money to work. This is a typical situation for a regulator to step in and hand out detention to the bullies in the class. (Or for an industry to realise that it needs to sort itself out, before the adults come in and start making stuff complicated.)",Android,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/p6r99j/why_voltevowifi_often_doesnt_work_on_your_android/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2019-05-02,1556826134,How expensive phones are strangling Android version distribution,"**TL, DR:** The dramatic increase in phone prices over the past few years has forced users to lengthen their hardware upgrade cycles. At the same time, the rate of Android updates hasn't matched this increase. As a result, the share of Android phones running less than the latest Android release is increasing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Google's original vision for hardware was for it to be inexpensive and easily replaced. However, Apple shifted the market perception preference (read: even if people can't afford top end devices, they judge the ecosystem based on top end devices) toward ultrapremium phones, forcing Android OEMs to follow suit.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, underlying ROM development and update methods didn't change nearly as much. Treble only meant that device OEMs no longer had to wait for SoC OEMs to provide them with kernel updates to push new ROM versions; it didn't change the work necessary to develop said ROMs. Most Android OEMs still aren't optimized for or organized around the software development methods necessary to push even regular security updates, much less feature/version ones.

&amp;#x200B;

And so now we have no Android OEM with global retail channel omnipresence (meaning you can get them from multiple retail channels nearly anywhere in the world) that pushes rapid monthly security updates and feature updates.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, because phones have gotten expensive, consumers can't afford to replace their hardware often. Even worse, due to locked bootloaders, the expertise required, and spotty custom ROM support, they often can't update their phones to the latest version of Android even if they wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

Google therefore finds itself in a serious jam: it needs the latest Android versions to penetrate the Android marketshare so that it can 1) provide improved device security and 2) incentivize devs to adopt new Android features and polices, but there's nothing they can do to push said updates. Even forcing devs to target Android API versions in the Play Store might not have much effect because, again: OEMs would rather release new devices with feature updates than push these updates to existing devices, and users neither care deeply about updates nor can they afford to upgrade devices.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it's tough for Google to make an argument for 2) above if their own numbers show no one is using the Android version they're telling devs to build for. As an example, consider the developer backlash against Scoped Storage\* that forced Google to delay enforcement for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, if competitive Android flagships were less expensive, it would make the above problem easier to solve (while admittedly harming Android's brand perception) because people would be more likely to upgrade their devices.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the distribution numbers themselves, I've seen Statcounter numbers bandied about a bit. Small reminder that Statcounter [counts pageviews](http://gs.statcounter.com/about), which inflates numbers for new releases as new users typically visit a lot pages getting their devices set up. In other words, Statcounter tracks activity, not install base. 

&amp;#x200B;

NetMarketShare, OTOH, [counts sessions](https://netmarketshare.com/methodology), which tracks closer to number of users. NetMarketShare puts Android 9.0's share of the overall mobile OS market at [1.18%](https://netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Mobile%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22platformVersion%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22platformsMobileVersions%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222018-05%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222019-04%22%2C%22plotKeys%22%3A%5B%7B%22platformVersion%22%3A%22Android%209.0%22%7D%5D%2C%22pageLength%22%3A100%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D). Since it also puts Android (all versions) at [70%](https://netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Mobile%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22platform%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22platformsMobile%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222018-05%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222019-04%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D), this means that 8 months after launch, **only 1.18/70 = 1.7% of Android devices run Pie**. A little Excel polynomial fit Kung Fu of the last 6 Pie distribution data points show **Pie will take nearly 1.5 years to reach just half of Android devices at its current rate**. Obviously, that's not something Google wants people talking a lot about.

# 1. Preface

Before getting my hands on Pixel 6, I was using a Samsung Galaxy S8 running on an Android 10 custom ROM. Samsung provides an advanced, and very useful app called [**Good Lock**](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock?langCd=en)**,** in which the **""One Hand Operation +""** feature helps us to set up **upto freaking 36 number of swipe gesture shortcuts,** from the left and right *(top, center and bottom)* sides of the screen, **irrespective of which** screen or app is currently active on the screen.

The only thing that I was sure about missing in Pixel 6 was this swipe gestures. That's why I did my research even before receiving my Pixel. Now I've successfully implemented a replica of the Samsung's swipe gesture into my Google Pixel.

These gestures makes it very easy to use this big and heavy smartphone.

**This gesture setup made it easy for me to pull up my** [Control Panel created in Tasker](https://imgur.com/a/G9EtuzZ)**, whenever I need, irrespective of which app or screen I'm in.**

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Requirements

* [**Tasker**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US)
* **Tasker terms** to understand ***(Only for those who are new to Tasker)***
   * `TASK` : An action or set of actions which will be later run by Tasker by itself, when defined conditions are met. Can also be run manually via the Tasker app.
      * *Examples: Launch an app, change ringer volume, toggle WiFI, disable auto rotation etc.*
   * `PROJECT` : An individual Tasker set up, where we define the conditions to meet, and the tasks to be performed when the defined conditions are met.
      * *Example 1: A profile which automatically enables the auto-rotation (task), when YouTube is opened (condition), and disables auto-rotation when you leave YouTube.*
      * *Example 2: A profile which automatically enables mobile data (task), when your device is connected to your car WiFi (condition) or Android Auto.*
   * `SCENE` : A visible, or invisible shape which will be displayed on the screen, and can be configured to respond to a swipe, tap or long tap on it, and then accordingly perform a pre-defined task. A scene can only be enabled *(show)* and disabled *(destroy)* through a task or a project.
      * *Example 1: A visible button that can be displayed on the screen, or an invisible location on the screen, which disables WiFi when we long tap on it.*
      * *Example 2: A visible button that can be displayed on the screen, or an invisible location on the screen, which opens recent apps list when we swipe on it.*
   * **""If"" variables** to be used in scenes for assigning shortcuts, to each combination of a swipe length and a swipe direction:
      * `%stroke_len` : Defines the length of the swipe in pixels.
      * `%stroke_dir` : Defines the direction of the swipe. *(Read* ***How It Works*** *section)*
   * **Actions** that can be performed on a scene:
      * `Tap`: A single touch, ON the scene.
      * `Long tap`:  Single touch &amp; holding, ON the scene.
      * `Stroke`:  A regular swipe **started FROM the scene**, and ended anywhere on the screen. *(Don't get confused, there are NO different swipe types like* ***long swipe***, or ***short swipe*** *in Tasker by default. For this project, we can mention a swipe with* `%stroke_len` *more than a user specified number as a* ***long swipe***, and a swipe shorter than that as a ***short swipe***.)

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Difficulty

You only need to know the basics of Tasker app and scenes. If you are okay with creating, editing, showing and destroying scenes, **then it's just a cakewalk.**

You just need to create scenes wherever you want, then inside the `tap`, or `long tap`, or `stroke` tabs of your scene, add the *if* statements with any one of `%stroke_len &gt;` or `%stroke_len &lt;`, `AND` `%stroke_dir ~` as two conditions, and then your desired set of actions inside each *if* statement, between `If` and `EndIf`. *(Refer* ***Demo, Screenshots &amp; Project Backup*** *section).*

If you are not comfortable with creating, editing, showing and destroying scenes, it will take maximum 1-2 hours to understand the same.

It is time consuming, only during the initial setup from the scratch. After that, it is just editing or adding conditions and shortcuts, **again,** **it's just a cakewalk.**

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. How it works!

Using the scenes inside Tasker, we are setting up three different areas on the screen, which are, top (horizontal), left and right (vertical). Inside each scene, we can make small multiple shapes, where we can add different tasks to each portion, when we do a swipe, tap or long tap on it.

When it comes to swipe, we can define the swipe length (using `%stroke_len`) and the swipe direction (using `%stroke_dir`), where we can assign different tasks to each conditions, which are made with a pair of a swipe length and a swipe direction.

What is more interesting is that the swipe directions can be any of vertical or horizontal directions like `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, or `Right`, and also diagonal directions like `UpLeft`, `UpRight`, `DownLeft` and `DownRight`. *(But try not to use vertical and diagonal directions together at a single location, as it might bring conflicts and may end up giving you wrong response because of failing to read your swipe correctly.)*

These gestures are NOT restricted to homescreen, but works **irrespective of which** screen or app is currently active on the screen *(Exception: To make scenes work in Settings app, you need to* ***Allow Screen Overlays in Settings*** *through developer options).*

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Uses

For instance, a task *(i.e, a set of actions)* can be assigned into a swipe gesture like `short swipe to UpLeft direction`, and another task to another swipe `long swipe to UpRight direction`, etc.

Examples:

1. **Short swipe** from left center edge in `UpRight` direction, *opens YouTube*.
2. **Short swipe** from right center edge in `DownLeft` direction, *jump to last app*.
3. **Long tap** on the top middle (1st scene) of the screen, *toggles WiFi*.
4. **Long tap** on the top middle (2nd scene) of the screen, *toggles mobile data*.
5. **Long swipe** from right top edge in `Up` direction, *takes a screenshot*.
6. **Long swipe** from right bottom edge in `Down` direction, *kill foreground app*.

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. Autorun

You can assign the same task *(which is set up to* ***show*** *the scene)*, to a new profile which gets triggered on the device boot. This will make these swipe gestures enable automatically few seconds (or so) after booting your smartphone.

However, you can always open the task inside Tasker app, and click on the play button (Ãµ) to run the task manually, which will show the scene (or enable the swipe gestures).

Since I'm using Nova Launcher, I also added the same task to a Nova's homescreen gesture, so that I can easily restart this swipe gesture from homescreen itself, whenever required, or just after editing the scene via Tasker. **This is very helpful because** whenever we edit a scene via Tasker, the scene will get automatically destroyed. So every time you modify a scene, we have to manually re-enable it.

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. Demo, screenshots, TaskerNet &amp; project backup

* **Demo:** 
   * **Google Pixel:** [In this screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/H8ualMy), I have mentioned all of the possibilities we have **for the Pixel 6, which doesn't get into conflict with the existing** system gestures provided by Google.
   * **Others**: I suggest using [these kind of directions](https://imgur.com/a/J50BTqM) in other android devices which doesn't have native gestures like `left` swipe from the right edge, and `right` swipe from the left side edge.
* **Screenshots:** This is the screen [where we edit or add](https://imgur.com/a/y99krPS) set of tasks to be performed, using `if` statements with conditions `%stroke_len &gt;` (or `%stroke_len &lt;`), `AND` `%stroke_dir ~`.
* **TaskerNet:** Projects for [Pixel 6](https://taskernet.com/shares/?user=AS35m8lghR%2BwkhToedtwQbasNiWa1nmlsnwTxFvYDZYoGKC0PkVkAkT%2BAypMZEZY7mVgAS2ky48%3D&amp;id=Project%3AGoodLock+Swipe+Gestures+%28Pixel+6%29) and [Galaxy S8](https://taskernet.com/shares/?user=AS35m8lghR%2BwkhToedtwQbasNiWa1nmlsnwTxFvYDZYoGKC0PkVkAkT%2BAypMZEZY7mVgAS2ky48%3D&amp;id=Project%3AGoodLock+Swipe+Gestures+%28Galaxy+S8%29).
* **Project Backup:** To start with setting up this project, if you want, you can also [refer to these regularly updated backup of my setup](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gJO_G6FQp5ZfJgid607uTcu5YVjJnuOd?usp=sharing) where I included all the ***scenes***, required ***task*** to activate the scene, and the ***project*** to autorun this setup on device boot. The folder includes files for both Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel 6. *(You can* [*refer here*](https://almost-a-technocrat.blogspot.com/2013/04/how-to-import-tasker-projects-profiles.html) *for assistance on how to import task and scene into your Tasker).*

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. Tips

1. If your device *(like Google Pixel)* already got a native swipe gesture like `left` swipe from the right screen edge, and `right` swipe from the left screen side edge, you should not create a similar gesture via Tasker, which will conflict with your existing system gestures.
2. Swipe direction `Down` from a top horizontal scene might also end up in issues since most of the Android devices natively use the same gesture to pull down notification panel.
3. Try not to use vertical directions and diagonal directions together. For example, in right side, don't use `Up` or `Down` series AND `UpLeft`, `DownLeft` series together. Both these series at a single location might bring conflicts and it may end up giving you wrong response because of failing to read your swipe correctly.
4. Try to avoid using `tap`. Instead, use `long tap`, to avoid accidental touches.
5. Always keep the size of the scenes thin, because these scene are ***blocking scenes*** which makes area behind it untouchable. So anything below the scene is impossible to touch. ***(Refer tip number 8 along with this)***
6. Always re-activate *(show)* the scene after making any changes, because making changes disables *(destroy)* the scene.
7. Assign the *(scene enabling)* task to any swipe gesture of your launcher like Nova *(if any),* to make restarting the scene easy. However, you can always open the *(scene enabling)* task via Tasker app itself, and click on the bottom left play button (Ãµ) to run the task manually.
8. [This is a workaround](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/rxfucc/comment/hrl3jau/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to make these blocking scenes hide temporarily so that we can touch whatever was behind the scene. *(Thanks to* [*user ActivateGuacamole*](https://www.reddit.com/user/ActivateGuacamole/) *for this idea)*
9. [Few other valuable tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/rxfucc/comment/hrl67ye/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for choosing the right swipe length for tasks considering their frequency of usage. *(Thanks to* [*user ActivateGuacamole*](https://www.reddit.com/user/ActivateGuacamole/) *for this idea)*

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. Why not those easy to use apps from PlayStore?

**Because Tasker is powerful. Period.**

I have tried few popular gesture setting apps but I always came back to Tasker itself because of the **level of control, and customization** we have here. Tasker can do **impressive automations,** which can also be implemented into this swipe gestures, something that can't be achieved with other easy to use and ready-made gesture apps.

With this method, **I can add a set of actions (not just one single action), one by one, to be performed, into one single gesture.** So if I wanted to do a swipe on the screen, and then another direction swipe, and then a click on a specific area, all these automatically, I can easily do with Tasker.

* Examples:
   * **Kill and remove foreground app from recent:** You can watch [this screen record video](https://imgur.com/a/CZ2AqqL) which shows my simple swipe gesture running the task where Tasker automates actions (a) open recent apps list, (b) a swipe action to swipe away the app, and (c) another swipe action to go to home screen. All this within a fraction of second. Impressive. isn't it?
   * **Clear all recent apps:** In Pixel 6, *clear all* button is placed at the end of the list. But [watch this one](https://imgur.com/a/KkFbSVI), a simple gesture is enough. Tasker will take care of the rest. **Again**, Impressive. Isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

**For implementing such complicated automations, advanced settings and toggling, all into a simple swipe gesture, Tasker is the best solution.**

&amp;#x200B;

# 10. End note.

It took days of [questions, answers, trail and errors](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/qonoxo/swipe_gestures_like_goodlocks_onehandoperation/) to first understand, and then to make this thing work flawless. Me and my couple of friends really find this useful in our smartphones, so I decided to share it with you also. If you find this useful for you, go ahead. And if you think this is not worth the time and effort required, you can kindly ignore.

I, a noob, wouldn't have made this possible without receiving a help from another person. So, a big thanks to u/adbenj for the [initial guide and idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/gllvdd/project_share_navigation_gestures_using_tasker/).

2020-07-12,1594558806,/r/android reviews: Huawei and Honor line.,"Device reviews are everywhere these days. From big name technology websites to lesser known blogs, and to the rising stars on YouTube. You can find hours upon hours of review content on most any well-known device out there. However a lot of these places do not focus on long term usage and fail to mention how devices hold up over the long term.

Additionally for those of you who like to hear about devices from actual users, it's hard to find a good place with reviews that aren't scattered all over the place.

This thread is where you, the /r/android community, can share your experiences with your device. Hopefully users who read this thread can gain some valuable insight into a device they're researching to see if they want to buy it. This week we are focusing on the [Huawei](https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sMakers=58&amp;sOSes=2) and [Honor](https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sMakers=121&amp;sOSes=2) of devices. 

Huawei and Honor are the second largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world by shipments according to [Counterpoint](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/). Huawei's phones have been praised for their camera performance and innovative hardware. Honor is Huawei's online centric brand which brings similar hardware(with some downgrades) for a lower price. Lately Huawei and Honor have had trouble outside China since they have lost access to Google Mobile Services so they cannot launch new phones with Google Apps and the Play Store.

2024-01-02,1704194230,[TUTORIAL] OnePlus 5 (cheeseburger) LineageOS 20 (Android 13),"I have a OnePlus 5 telephone for 6 years by now and I am so satisfied with it, that I am not willing to change it, I will use it till I can.

**Prologue:**

To maintain a phone for that long I had to repair it a lot, mostly broken screens.2 years ago I ended up with a thirdparty LCD screen that caused constant black screens after locking the phone, the only remedy was restarting it... so it became useless this way.Turned out upper than Android 8 the screen was unusable, I think it was a driver issue.So I used my phone with Android 8 OxygenOS, it was good till the end of 2023. Some apps security requirements asked for minimum Android 9. So It was time to make a change...

I decided to try out a custom ROM and I choosed LineageOS. Not to mention the newest based on Android 13. I have done some twiking with mobile and their softwares, but honestly I am a real amateur. The infromation was so scattered around, it was hard to puzzle together all the pieces.So I wanted to give help to those who are in the same shoe as me.

**What will be needed:**

2013-01-17,1358395617,Let's talk security/anti-theft,"I recently stumbled on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/16phoy/just_like_that/), where an individual had their phone stolen by someone cruising down the street on a bike. They didn't have time to react and within 1 second it was too late. So what would you do in this situation? Do you have anything in place to prevent a thief from accessing all your information? After recently having a phone stolen, I do now.. 

Someone in that thread mentioned Cerberus and I intended to make a short post, but it turned into a rant.. So here's that rant for more to see, maybe it'll help someone if they're ever in this situation (but hopefully you never are).

***With Cerberus you can't detect it's there or even running when it is.*** The average Android user has no theft protection and since Android has no built in protection, most thieves wouldn't think twice about it being installed or even where to look/how to disable it if they did know.

***Cerberus works like this*** - you give the app administrative access on the phone and then hide the icon from the app drawer using the in-app settings. In order for a thief to know it's there, they would have to use a file explorer, navigate to /data/app and go thru every app there looking for once that might be an anti-theft app and then delete it. Who the hell would know to do that? Most would hard reset it and be done. 

***So how do you access it then?*** You set up an access code, then go to your dialer, dial the code and bam - the app opens. Otherwise, it's completely hidden. 

***Oh ok, so you can just hard reset it and the thief is off free?*** Wrong. The app has a root setup, so if you have a rooted device, the app can install to /system/app, which is where other applications like your dialer and messages apps are, thus is completely unaffected by a hard reset. The only way it can be removed is with a file explorer with root access, navigating to /system/app, searching and deleting it OR if they know your access code OR by flashing a new rom/firmware. 

***Riiight..so how do you use the app if someone hard resets your phone and puts in a new sim?*** When you initially setup the app, you supply it with a set of trusted phone numbers (I have these set to my parent's phones and my Google voice number), so if the thief replaces the sim card, a text message is sent to these trusted numbers with the new sim card's number. So then you can send commands from any phone to that number and do as you please (track, lock, alarm, sms log, call log, display message, take pictures..etc..) or you can login thru the website and control it from there. And just to reiterate, as someone else pointed out, Cerberus runs off sms commands (which of course aren't actually displayed in your messaging inbox), so no data connection is needed to run any commands.

Now, my next step might initially seem counter intuitive, but *it's actually in my best interest for a thief to be able to use my phone so I can then control it.* Yeah, I have a pattern unlock set to deter friends/family/girls from getting in, but this could easily be bypassed if someone does a hard reset (turn the device off, hold volume key + home key + power button, wipe) and this is something most thieves *would* know how to do or would be able to figure out with a quick search. Then, I have the device SIM unlocked and have no pin set or device encryption set.. ***Why?*** Well, what this does is *allows anyone with a sim card on any carrier to stick it in and use the phone*....thus allowing me to control the phone. If they can't get in the phone, they won't use it and I can't control it.

I would also like to say that Avast! has all the same features as Cerberus and is definitely worth checking out for anyone in that market. Additionally, it also allows you to rename the app, so if someone does happen to be browsing thru /system/app hunting for it (which no one would do, bc if you know how to do that, then you know how to flash a rom), they would see something like ""data_manager.apk"" instead of ""avast.apk"".

**tl;dr** - I'm very into mobile security and after recently having a device stolen, I have developed, what I think to be, an extremely solid strategy in case this happens again. 

**Please post any additional information or tips!!!**

The times are coming that Android is now the best-selling mobile OS (operating system) and the phones are getting more and more powerful everyday. As such, people want to get the most out of their phone as possible WITHOUT paying more for services from their phone carrier.



* How do I turn my phone into a free wireless hotspot?
* How do I get cool, custom themes that won't slow my phone down?
* How do I get my phone to go faster?


All these questions and much much more can be answered by one simple answer: By Rooting your phone.

Of course, getting into rooting your phone and browsing the internet for answer can often be a confusing experience especially if its your first time. So what this article will do is explain to you the following:



* What rooting is (In easy to understand terms)
* Why should you root your phone? (The Pros and Cons)
* and a break down the common language you'll while rooting your phone.


Lets go ahead and get started.

**What is exactly is rooting?**

When you go buy your phone from whatever carrier you choose, it will come with restrictions on it. These restrictions are to make sure you don't accidentally mess up your phone or, the most common of the explanations are done by carriers (Verizon, Sprint, ATT, etc) to limit the capabilities of what you're able to do with your phone so they can ""Add those features"" and pay money for them.

The Android operating system is a Linux operating system, while I could make a whole article on that operating system; we'll stick to what you need to know. Rooting gives you system permissions for your entire phone. This gives you the ability to change and customize your phone that what is normally allowed.

That is what is referred to as ""Root access"" hence the term rooting. Basically, you're just getting full administration priveleges on your phone.

This leads us to our next section which you will need to read or at least intently skim over, which is the vocabulary you will encounter and you will need to know for the future.

***Common terms, phrasing and words you will encounter now that you entered the wild world of rooting.***

**ROMs** - The term ROM literally stands for ""Read Only Memory"". In this particular case of phones, it refers to reading your phones internal memory where your firmware and applications are stored. When people say they are putting (Commonly referred to as flashing) a new firmware on their phone, it means they are installing a new ROM. The two terms (Firmware and ROMs) can be used interchangeably.



* A custom ROM (example: CyanogenMods) give you tweaks, enhanced performance or added features onto your phone. It just depends which ROM you pick and what it has to offer.


**Flashing** - Flashing just refers in the rooting world just refers to updating (Or changing) firmware.



* There are programs that ""Flash"" new firmware onto your system should you decide to install custom ROMs or even just manually flash a stock ROM. (Example: the ODIN program but there are many more out there.


**Bootloaders** - This term and process seem to cause the most confusion for people and scare them away from rooting. The term bootloading refers to a code that is launched before any operating system is launched (Like Android, iOS, Windows, etc) without going too much into detail bootloading is packagingthe instructions to boot operating system kernel and most of them also have their own debugging or modification environment.



* On the Android OS a bootloader is usually locked on an Android device because although its an open source OS, still the manufacturers want you to stick to their Android OS version specifically designed for the device. In order to apply this concept, manufacturers lock the bootloader. With a locked bootloader on Android devices, it is virtually impossible to flash a Custom ROM.

**Bricking** - This means messing up your phone to where it won't work anymore. Essentially turning it into a brick.



=======================================

Okay so now moving onto why the reasons you should or should not root your phone, carefully analyzing the pros and cons. So lets start off with...

**Why should I root my phone?**

As explained in the previous sections, rooting grants you system administration permissions over your entire phone. This gives you the pros of the following

Installing new Custom Roms gives your phones new themes AND new features to mess around with, not limiting you to the stock versions found on your phone.

Turn your phone into a free WiFi hotspot. This is a big reason for most people to root their phone (It was for me) since most carriers charge a monthly fee of $30 USD to even unlock this feature.
Make your phone function faster or let the battery last longer with select apps.
Use applications that need root access (Such as Titanium Back-up Pro. A great back-up utility that is a must have for all rooted users. But more on that later.

This are generally the most reasons why people go into rooting. But you want to hear about the cons right? Its only fair.

**What are the cons to rooting my phone?**

There are some downsides to rooting your phone and the most immediate reasons are the following...

* Rooting your phone DOES void your warranty. However, your carrier will only know that you rooted your phone if you go to them with phone rooted. If you un-root your phone (Easily done) then nobody would be the wiser.

* There is a possibility of bricking your phone. However not all bricks are perma-bricks and some are reversible but is pain in the ass and hassle should you brick your phone. There is a low possibility of this with the quality and quantity of guides out there but there is always a possibility.

 **It is incredibly hard to truly brick and Android phone. If the phone turns on, or responds at all, there is hope for you phone especially with the advent and popularity of the ""One Click Root"" Methods available for many devices.**

And...thats it

That is virtually all the cons to rooting your phone. Alot of people have this dreaded feeling that rooting is actually a lot more dangerous than it really is and it scares them off. With this beginning acquaintance guide it should help dispell some beliefs. 

If by the end of the article you are still unsure if you are ready to root or not, just ask yourself if you need the features listed above in the ""Pro"" section. If there are features you would really love to have; then go for it. If you feel that you could get along just fine, then there is nothing wrong with not rooting your phone. 

Happy Rooting.

2014-07-13,1405278882,DIY-Blackphone [Work-In-Progress],"Earlier today there was a thread asking about making a completely Google-free phone with security and no mobile data [so you can't be tracked by cell towers.] I put together a few ideas and while I don't have a working copy of this [I don't have a Replicant supported phone] I was wondering if anyone had any better ideas. [My earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2alau0/an_article_about_a_google_free_android_caught_my/ciwb1zj) was kinda long so I'm just going to quote it, though I'll rewrite it more like instructions if this post picks up.

&gt; First you'd probably want to start with [Replicant](http://www.replicant.us/) and [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/) for your apps. If you're using a phone you already have you'd want to build it yourself, leaving out any cellular stuff so the mobile data just wont work. Preferably, you'd have a way to power it down if you can.
&gt;
&gt;On my tablet, the built in Android disk encryption required me to put in a password on boot or it wouldn't boot into the system. Not sure if it works the same way on Replicant, but it should.
&gt;
&gt;For VPN, hosting your own would probably be best. If you have a router that supports DD-WRT you can have the [VPN hosted on your router](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/VPN) so you don't need a computer or anything running. If not, to save energy you could probably set up a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to do it, or just leave your main computer on with a VPN running. The router way is the best, IMO, because if your computer crashes or windows update runs or something it might not start back up automatically.
&gt;
&gt;Since you're using Replicant, Android Device Manager is out of the question for remote wipe. There are tons of apps that work, I believe most people here prefer [Cerberus](https://www.cerberusapp.com/), but it's not open source and it's a paid app so that might be out of the question too. If you go the Raspberry Pi method for the VPN, you could use it to host [Open Device Manager](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2601720) as well, an open source clone of ADM (or just host it on your desktop.)
&gt;
&gt;If you really must use Google apps [obviously not recommended since you're trying to go completely Google free], you can set up something using [Â¼g (MicroG)](https://github.com/microg), a free, ""fully compatible"" replacement of the GAPPS package. There's a maps framework, location provider, Google play services compatibility implementation, and a play store implementation. Alternatively, if you just want some apps from the play store, you can use the [Raccoon Google Play desktop client](http://www.onyxbits.de/raccoon) (made by /u/pocketbandit) and download APKs to sideload.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, I would make sure to root and install [XPrivacy](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2320783) [or another privacy manager] to block any and all apps from accessing things they don't need to, and an ad blocker to make sure you aren't tracked by any ad companies.

&gt;Now, I'm not sure how well any of this works together, I kinda just put this together from memory, remembering that all of these things exist. I haven't tried any of these personally except for the DD-WRT VPN and XPrivacy. If anyone has any notes about the stuff I've listed or suggestions for alternatives that would be cool too.

Also, after a bit of research into Blackphone I also added this:

&gt;You can get the Silent Circle apps they use for texting/calling if you put together a phone using Replicant, too. The SpiderOak file sync should be pretty secure for syncing to a PC instead of using DropBox or something, but you can probably put together something with BitTorrent Sync so you don't have to contact an outside server (I think? I've never used these either...)

I'm planning on trying to build something like this once I get a Replicant supported phone, but I'm a little short on cash so for now this is all just an idea. If anyone has suggestions for apps or even a different OS that would be great. Thanks for reading!

WIP Instructions for setting this up. These will be a bit vague, because step by step instructions for this should be available for each individual app [I'll try to link to these.] When I finish these instructions I'll move them up to the top of the post, until then they'll stay at the bottom.

Okay, so, you want to secure your Android phone a bit more. You might not be able to complete all these steps [specifically installing Replicant; it's only available for [a few devices](http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki#Replicant-Status).] What you can't do will obviously leave you a bit less secure, but whatever you *can* do with your phone will obviously help! Let's get started.


1. 
    1. [IMO the hardest step] Install [Replicant OS](http://www.replicant.us/), a free and open source (FOSS), security focused Android based operating system. This will replace your Android OS and you *must* wipe your data, so make sure you back up anything you need. To do this you should have a little bit of background rooting and installing custom ROMs. [Here are instructions on the Replicant Wiki for a few devices](http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki#Installing-Replicant). Of course, if you are a developer, you can try to build Replicant for your device, provided there are open source drivers for your phone's hardware.
    2. Alternatively, if Replicant isn't available for your device, you can install another AOSP based ROM such as Cyanogenmod. This will be less secure as there is usually some proprietary code (such as drivers), but it will be free of Google Play Services and lacking the GAPPS package. Note: You don't want to install GAPPS if you're trying to be Google-free. You wont have the app store, but we'll get to that in the next step.
2. 
    1. Once you're on your new OS, you're going to need some apps! [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is a wonderful FOSS application repository (or app store). You'll have to download the APK from the website and install it manually. There is an FAQ on the F-Droid wiki, or you can post in the F-Droid forums if you need help. There are some great apps and games on the main F-Droid repo, such as: [2048](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.uberspot.a2048), [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway) (I recommend this to block tracking via ads), [AcDisplay](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.achep.acdisplay), [AFWall+](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=dev.ukanth.ufirewall) (firewall), [Apollo Music Player](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.andrew.apollo), and that's only in the first few pages of apps!
    2. For FOSS encrypted calling/messaging/browsing solutions, I recommend the apps from [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/). They have an [F-Droid repository](https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository/) to easily install and keep the apps updated, and of course they're free.
    3. If you want the Silent Circle apps [secure contacts/phone/texts, same apps as Blackphone], I believe you can get them from the [Silent Circle website](https://silentcircle.com/) though they do cost money and I don't believe they are open source.
    4. Finally, if an app you want is only on the Play store, you can use [Raccoon](http://www.onyxbits.de/raccoon) to download the APKs on your desktop and install them manually on your phone.
3. WIP.
    1. Install XPrivacy, lock down your apps network and/or device access if the app doesn't need it (local games with network access? Browser requesting access to contacts for some reason? Block those permissions so they can't get your data.)
    2. From here, install DD-WRT on your router if you want to host a VPN there, otherwise get a raspberry pi to host it or host from your desktop PC.
    3. Install Open Device Manager on the Pi or your Desktop for remote management.",Android,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2alqi9/diyblackphone_workinprogress/,irrelevant,"Okay, here?™s the stance based on the Reddit post:

2018-07-06,1530881341,Messaging.,"I know this topic is super beat into the ground, but I feel like it's an important thing to discuss until it's fixed, which may never happen. 

For years, I've used Google Hangouts to talk to most people regularly. My only gripe with it is how obscenely long it takes to send photos. 

I tried Allo (before they forgot about it), but not having tablet (multi-device) support really sucked. No one used it either and no SMS fallback sucked. DOA

I use Telegram X to talk to some people and it's nice enough, but few people use Telegram compared to WhatsApp and other services. 

Google's RCS push is nice. On the Pixel 2 XL on T-Mobile, I still can't use RCS in Android Messages. Even if I could, it's still not encrypted. More importantly than that, iOS will never support such an open standard. Just now, I was messaging someone who owns an iPhone on Hangouts. She would be the equivalent of a ""green bubble buddy"" if we were to SMS/use RCS because none of the rich chat features would work. 

Additionally, Android Messages doesn't have multi-device support. I know I'm one of the three people globally that uses an Android tablet daily (I'm writing this on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S3), but with Google making Duo (a fantastic app) available for multiple devices (similar to FaceTime), you'd think they might with Android Messages as well. Using the web interface on a tablet is kind of janky. 

I know I'm preaching to the choir, but I really wish there was a good, encrypted, and truly multi-platform app that worked well and that people actually used. This will never happen because the open solution is always less secure and Apple will never support it. Apple's option will obviously never work on other platforms. This is why texting is still around. It would just be nice if Apple supported RCS and everyone could use rich chat features regardless of mobile operating system, and hopefully soon, regardless of mobile carrier.

Yes, I know that if you insist on using crappy stuff like Facebook there is little chance that Android vs Apple will make any difference.

Also yes, I know there are projects like [GrapheneOS](https://www.yugatech.com/news/grapheneos-is-a-security-and-privacy-focused-mobile-operating-system/) that is (in terms of privacy and security) not only better than any stock Android device but probably also better than any stock Apple device but such projects are hard to follow for over 99% of normal users (but you can take a look anyway - /r/GrapheneOS - and maybe even test-drive it or help with it).

But such projects will hardly solve the actual problem - so the question remains what needs to be done? Would it be enough to push Android manufacturers to become better in this regard?

2019-11-10,1573383151,"Niche problem: I haven't found an android phone that streams at 60FPS, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.","**This thread, as far as I can tell, is not tech support in nature. This thread revolves around a niche industry at best in the western world.**            

After using maybe two or three different android phones from different manufacturers and built on different specs each, I feel like the ability to livestream has been capped at 30 FPS, regardless of the platform and hardware specifications.             

The issue: producing **some** media on your phone at 60FPS as well as livestreaming at 60FPS simple is not doable. Recording and playing back video that you've made with your phone at 60FPS can be done, but livestreaming cannot be. At this point I am pretty sure this is an android operating system issue, not an issue with any smart phone I've used.              

To be more specific, I previously used an ASUS Zenfone 4 with 6GB of RAM and an 8th generation (8--) QUALCOMM processor. Now I'm using the higher end Note 10+ when I try livestreaming (and I've used a wide variety of apps as well as external tools (capture cards)) with nothing getting above 30FPS.             

I'm sure maybe this is something that might be in the pipeline from android in the future?

**EDIT: this threads been up for close to 48 hours. Let me discuss briefly previous and current standards where a mobile device can / could produce a 60 FPS stream.**

For reference, if I recall correctly, the Samsung S7 was capable of streaming at 60FPS. I also know for a fact that some of the more recent iPhones can livestream at 60FPS.

Edit: Removing the battery of newer smartphones does not circumvent them being turned on remotely. RTC (real time clock) batteries or PRAM  have been made stronger to be remotely turned on and power the GPS and NFC. RTC/ PRAM batteries are not strong enough to power a phone call but they are strong enough to enable geostalking.

Storing NFC devices in mylar bags when not in use is not a solution. High power RFID/NFC scanners can go through aluminum.

Boycott NFC smartphones and tablets. Below is a list of NFC devices.

Note that older iphones and ipads are not on the NFC lists. Apple does not use RFID and NFC. Newer iphones uses iBeacon which uses low energy bluetooth. http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/07/the-open-secret-of-ibeacon-apple-could-have-250m-units-in-the-wild-by-2014/

I am mentioning older CDMA Apple as a poor alternative. Unfortunately, iphone 6 has both iBeacon and NFC. Fortunately, since NFC has been identified on the motherboard, it can be destroyed via drilling.
http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/29/alleged-iphone-6-nfc-chip-and-working-hardware-shown-in-latest-leaks

Where is the NFC chip in android smartphones and tablets? I have researched schematics and photographs of motherboards of tablets. None identify RFID/NFC. Could someone please describe what the chip looks like so it can be destroyed with a drill?

Specifications of smartphones and tablets do not include RFID or NFC. Could redditors please update the list of NFC tablets? Do the cheap Chinese ARM and MIPS tablets have RFID/NFC? 

Starting in 2011, there is an industry wide world wide movement to embed NFC in all SIM cards.
http://www.extremetech.com/mobile/105683-nfc-enabled-sim-cards-to-become-a-worldwide-standard

CDMA does not use SIM cards. Switching to an older android CDMA smartphone and/or tablet or older CDMA smartphones and/or tablets with other operating systems is a solution. 

Personally, I have a CDMA Palm Treo 705i and just purchased a replacement CDMA HP Palm Pre2. They neither have RFID, NFC nor iBeacon.

To make it a bit more objective, I suggest that there are some basic categories which define the rank of a smartphone in your personal top 3: display, sound, software, feeling, battery, camera, gimmicks/features.

Feel free to also list your disappointments!

My personal top 3: 

1.) Note 8: Although not owning one (but using one multiple times), I'm impressed simply because the hardware which Samsung always almost nails these days is on par with the software. The cameras are great, battery life is good enough, the software has useful features and it just feels right.

2.) HTC U11: Yeah, I own one and I love it - nothing more to say. The camera needs some manual adjustments to be truly stunning which it now is. Apart from that it has snappy software, good battery life, a really good non-OLED display and the best non-frontfacing speakers I ever had in a smartphone. It also looks so utterly gorgeous! &lt;3

3.) Samsung Galaxy S8 (and S8+): pretty much close to the same reasons of the Note 8, I personally really like it. My fiancee and my best friend both have one and I think it's just a generally good phone.

So what about you? What is you personal favorite top 3 and why?",Android,198,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/77spfh/with_all_the_big_ones_out_there_rank_your_top_3/,pro_android,"Stance: pro_android

2021-11-29,1638193382,I tested two 1TB microSDXC cards in four Android phones from 2016 through 2020. What kind of differences can you expect between U3/A2 speed cards from different price classes?,"Images and graphics related to this post on Imgur: [https://imgur.com/a/3nCa34x](https://imgur.com/a/3nCa34x) . There is also a [Google Drive spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxl1PRKbnlc0-7uO3BfTfXodhfVAasdgdXz8R8OBPLM/edit?usp=sharing) with my measurements and details of the hardware used.

# TLDR;

A smartphone's internal storage will typically offer you up to 10x higher read and write speeds than removable microSD can. The Sandisk Extreme PRO 1TB (U3/A2) offers double the write speed as the more budget-oriented Amazon Basics 1TB (U3). Read access is very similar all around. If you do write-intensive things with your storage, such as 4K video, it could be worth looking out for deals for a premium brand SD card, rather than going for the cheapest U3/A2 option.

In spite of using the Sandisk Extreme Pro 1TB in 3 different daily drivers over the past year, I saw no degradation of its performance. By contrast, I did see such degradation in some of my older cards in my 2020 test. However, note that I never exceeded 85% storage on the Extreme Pro 1TB.

# Becoming a rare feature

Micro SD seems to be disappearing from new smartphones. Of course iPhones and Google Pixels never had SD slots for storage expansion. But in recent years, also Samsung (which produces microSD cards) has released flagships without the expansion option. Of course plenty of midrange and budget Android phones still give you the option for removable storage. The only major brand that currently offers the option with their flagships, is Sony with their Experia 1 and 5 lines and the recently announced Pro-I.

Until early this year, when they announced leaving the smartphone market, LG also produced flagships with SD slots. For this comparison, I used 4 of my LG phones released between 2016 and 2020.

# 2020 vs 2021: two new phones and two the same

Last year, I did an [elaborate test of seven A1/A2/U3 microSDXC cards in four Android phones](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/k1o0rz/are_highspeedhighcapacity_a1_a2_u3_microsd_cards/) that I had available then, including one V20 running Nougat. In 2020, I did not have the V60 and V50 yet to test with. Last year, two of the phones ran Android 10, this year three of the four run Android 11.

During my most recent tests, I did not find anything that contradicts with my findings from then, so I still highly recommend [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/k1o0rz/are_highspeedhighcapacity_a1_a2_u3_microsd_cards/), if you haven't read it already.

# 01 - Read Speeds (MB/s)

|Brand|Internal Storage 1)|Sandisk|Amazon Basics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Speed branding||A2/U3 (Extreme PRO, Black/Gold)|U3|
|Capacity||1TB|1TB|
|LG V60|1394|90|80|
|LG G8X|745|66|77|
|LG V50|732|69|84|
|LG V20|456|73|58|
|***Average***||78|76|

(**Sequential) Read speeds - My takeaway:**   Relatively small range between cards: 62-78 MB/s

# 02 - Write Speeds (MB/s)

|Brand|Internal Storage 1)|Sandisk|Amazon Basics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Speed branding||A2/U3 (Extreme PRO, Black/Gold)|U3|
|Capacity||1TB|1TB|
|LG V60|726|63|27|
|LG G8X|488|62|26|
|LG V50|479|60|28|
|LG V20|154|45|22|
|***Average***||59|26|

(**Sequential) Write speeds - My takeaway -**  Large range: 26-59 MB/s - so expect big differences in performance. The speed differences are also significant on the oldest V20.

# How I tested

* Room **temperature** \- in the frisky 17-19 Celsius (62-66 F) range in my case
* **No case or skin** \- cases and skins can impact heat dissipation and thus SoC temperature and influence results
* **Airplane mode ON** \- poor cellular (indoors) and Wifi reception can keep the SoC and battery busy, which can blur the results
* **Localization (GPS) OFF** \- same reason as airplane mode
* **Anti-malware de-installed** \- BitDefender Security installed on several phones. I had it de-installed for running the tests.
* **Battery in the 30%-100% range** \- Below 30% battery, heat and performance effects can occur. Not something you want to blur results with.
* **No charging** during benchmark runs - Charging = heat = potential performance impact
* **No USB-C devices connected** during benchmark runs (although I use it for screenshots in between tests)
* At least 34% **free space** on tested medium. Last year, I noticed that available space can have an impact on the performance, especially with certain longer used cards. For this 1:1 comparison I actually cloned the contents of my Sandisk daily driver card to the Amazon Basics one. So both had the exact same data set.
* Like for the 2020 tests, I started out with using the elaborate **AndroBench** app. I ran 3 tests for each combination. Unfortunately, the app is no longer maintained and it does not work well with SD cards anymore since Google made changes in Android 11. It does still work well with internal storage and on the V20 running Oreo. Several other apps had similar problems, but **SD Card Test** by developer **Zoltan Pallagi** worked OK.

2018-06-05,1528205779,My LG G7 Review + Camera samples!,"After planning a last-minute trip to Budapest this past month, I was given the opportunity by LG to review the new G7. As luck would have it, I received the device just before departing the trip which gave me an excellent opportunity to put the device through its paces. Lets face itmy day-to-day life isnt all that exciting or a very rigorous test at all for a phone. 

So does the G7 pass the technical tests while being attractive, comfortable to hold, and loaded with good software? For the most part, yes.

**Battery Life**

Since I answered the previous question with For the most part I figured it would be best to start with the area where the phone falls a little short. If youve read any of the existing articles dedicated solely to this aspect of the phone, then youre probably not surprised that its the battery. 

The few days I used the phone before my trip, I was pretty happy with the battery life I was getting. After a day of usage, I sat at 16 percent with 5 and a half hours of screen on time. For most people, Id say this I more than enough and a couple of years ago it might have even been commendable. And really, after having that experience with the phone I was surprised to see articles pointing out that the phone had lackluster battery life. Vacation, however, was a slightly different story. 

Like I said, traveling is a pretty rigorous test for a smartphone, and isnt representative of how youll use the phone 99% of the time. When you do travel, however, or have an extended period of time without access to a charger, you want a phone whose battery you can rely on. 

I planned ahead and brought a mobile power bank with me to charge all of my devices on the plane or at the airport if needed. It also ended up being nice insurance for my phone on long days in the city because by the end of most days I was cutting it close with the G7 after roughly three and a half hours of screen-on time. To be fair, most of the screen usage was at max brightness using Google Maps (which means GPS was pinged a lot) so thats just about as demanding as it gets for a phone. But after grabbing dinner on some days, the phone was about ready to call it quits and needed some juice from the power bank.

I feel bad complaining about the battery life after putting the phone through the ringer, but a phone like the S9 might have had just enough more battery life to get me through the rest of the day without topping it off. 

If youre like me and dont travel a ton, however, this probably shouldnt bother you. There arent many cases where youre putting a phone through such a stress test like I did on my trip.

**Display**

Yes, theres a notch. Youve probably already made up your mind about how you feel about the notch. Interestingly, LG refers to the extra space created by the notch as the New second screen. Im guessing this is a reference to the old second screen that was on the V20, but it lacks all of the functionality of that old second screen, so Im not sure why they call it that. Regardless, the notch doesnt bother me at all, and youd be surprised at how quick you get used to it. If you dont like it, however, theres not much you can do. Yes, theres an option to make the status bar black, but unfortunately that only works for LGs appswhich pretty much means just the home screen and the settings app.

The panel itself ditches OLED in favor of IPS. Its definitely noticeable, and there are times when I miss having an OLED. But I do enjoy the benefits, too. The main one is the 1000 nits of brightness that the display can be boosted to. This means that even in the brightest sunlight, screen content can still be seen. Its a really nice feature that Ive already used multiple times.

**Software**

LGs software has slowly improved over the past handful of years, but still doesnt offer a whole lot over the stock Android experience. Ever so slowly, LG is building a distinctive look to its skin, and with this go-around, most things about their skin are ever so slightly more attractive. For one, their icons are redesigned with a subtle background gradient and white foreground. The font they use on the ambient display is now bolder and more slender to match the design of the phone. Altogether I dont have any complaints, but Im not exactly blown away.

On the phone I received, LG has ditched their own Messaging and Email apps in favor of Googles. This was a nice change from previous phones, since their messaging app in particular was rather ugly. On the negative side, however, theyve included Facebook and Instagrambut it looks like those can both be uninstalled.

Probably the thing I like most about LGs software is their launcher. I dont know if I prefer it to Googles, but its surprisingly minimalist and fluid. After enabling the app drawer, I havent felt the need to install a third-party launcher, because the default does everything I need it to (although I dont ask much of it).

There are also a handful of quick tiles youll find for features that arent on stock Android. For any audiophiles out there, theres DTS:X 3D Surround and the Hi-Fi Quad DAC weve come to expect from LGs phones. The built-in screenshot quick tile is also nice, and a much better alternative to the traditional, awkward button combination.

The only real complaint I have about the software is that theyve removed the ability to make the navbar background black. You can now make it blue or green or pink-- but not black. I was never a fan of how the background white by default, but it really annoys me that I dont even have the option to make the background black anymore.

**Hardware**

Like their software, the physical design of LGs latest phone is iterative. Thats not a bad thing at all, since the same is true for Samsung phones over the past couple years, and I actually really like the design of the G7. I have the Aurora Black color, and I have to say its pretty sleek. It might not blow anybody away, but then again, neither will most phones out there

The aspect ratio the phone has gives it a good width that makes it comfortable to hold. Unlike the G6, the edges of the front glass are curved, which also does a ton to make the phone more comfortable to hold. In fact, I was just about as shocked as one can be when looking at phone specs to learn that its the same thickness as the G6 which doesnt have rounded glass on the front.

The power button has been decoupled from the fingerprint scanner and moved to the side on the G7. Combining them was a good idea, but the execution and function really fell short of LGs intentions on previous devices. After using the V30 for months, the combined scanner/power button always felt unnatural and it had weird quirks and random moments of non-functionality that I came to resent. The rear power button was probably the most distinctive feature of LG phones, but it was time to move on.

New to the G7 is the assistant button on the left side. I do occasionally trigger it, but not often enough that it annoys me. Its a nice alternative to the squeeze function that the pixels have, and it feels a lot like using a walkie talkie, just with a virtual human on the other side. Id probably use it a lot more if I didnt have to unlock the phone before it let me use it. If you dont want to use it at all, you can change the assistant or disable it altogether.

Altogether the phone feels solid and premium with a glass back, aluminum sides, and a surprising amount of heft.

**Camera**

Im far from an expert with photography, but I really enjoyed the quality of the G7s camera. Photos are clear and crisp, with a nice amount of color. The AI CAM mode isnt all that useful from what I found, and is pretty slow overall. The camera does, however, have a built-in Super bright mode that boosts brightness in low light situations by using fewer megapixels. Having the wide-angle lens (like previous LG phones) is super useful when taking photos on vacation. There were countless times where I was standing in front of a building unable to capture the entirety of it with the conventional lens. The wide-angle lens had no issue capturing it all.  Ill include a gallery of some of the photos Ive taken on vacation for you to consider yourself.

https://imgur.com/a/ClrhfnH

**Conclusion**

A lot of review outlets and journals have called the G7 boring or unimaginative. There is some truth there when comparing it to the V30, but going only a year back to the G6, the G7 is a remarkably better phone. The phone has tough competition between Samsung, but on sale this phone is a great choice. In fact, it looks like Best Buy has it on sale already:

2015-10-11,1444602379,Are the useful features on smartphones starting to slow down in their progress?,"I remember when the first smartphones came out, they were a huge innovation over normal cellphones but still offered a huge room for improvement and it was highly noticeable for the end-user aswell.

Then with the years we've seen a lot of major improvements which helped greatly in ease of use and overall  feel and look of the devices.

But right now I feel like we reached a sort of a plateau with most of the new features of smartphones becoming gimmicky or downright useless in most cases.

I've been thinking about it since I started doing some researches on new devices after deciding to buy a new phone since my Note 2 started showing the signs of aging.

Whenever I changed phone before I usually was excited to see what kind of new feature X brand and Y model offered over others and what amazing features I'd be able to use by getting such device but right now, after looking for a while at the new stuff that there's around I don't really feel there's much difference from what I already have on my 3 years old phone.

Is it just me feeling like this or does anyone else have the same feeling? 

Did you find some features/hardware improvements that are exclusive of new devices that you actually find useful and use on a daily basis?

I just rewatch [MKBHD's video](https://youtu.be/TI4PXFUOPR8) of the Galaxy S10e and remembers all the hype there was surrounding the S10e. It funny how we can easily forget something after the hype of the product had faded away.

The phone was launched for $750, but the price of the phone had dropped to the range of $500-$550, directly competing with the OP 7, Zenfone 6, and maybe even the K20 Pro.

For a person with small hands, I just love how [small and pocket-able the S10e](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e,OnePlus-7-Pro/phones/11114,11168) really is

- SD 855 / Exynos 9820
- 6/8 GB of RAM with 128/256 GB of UFS 2.1 storage
- 12 MP wide camera with OIS and variable aperture (F1.5 - F2.4)
- 16 MP ultra-wide camera
- 10 MP front camera, capable of shooting 4k videos
- 960 fps slow mo videos 
- FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED HDR10+ flat display with a hole-punch design. 
- Fast wireless charging,and wireless powershare
- IP68 water &amp; dust resistance
- Pretty loud stereo speakers
- Dolby Atmos support
- Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0
- Fast side fingerprint scanner
- Samsung's One UI
- A HEADPHONE JACK

There is so much hardware that you're getting from a tiny package. Combined that with the lowered price tag and Samsung's brand image, I personally think the S10e is the best value smartphone right now.

2025-01-22,1737569046,"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.

## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos

[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.

Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.

These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.

Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.

## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app

[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.

Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.

## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and services

Although Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.

Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.

Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.

## New Gemini extensions for Samsung apps

Google also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:

*   **Samsung Calendar**
    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar
    *   Capture info from images to create events
    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events
*   **Samsung Clock**
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms
    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers
*   **Samsung Notes**
    *   Create and summarize notes
    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles
*   **Samsung Reminder**
    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date
    *   Edit a reminders name, time or date
    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date
    *   Delete reminders",Android,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1i7hg55/gemini_is_getting_smarter_with_apps_youtube/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2014-10-16,1413464314,Some interesting features from L,"-Notifications
&gt;With Lollipop, incoming phone calls wont interrupt what youre watching or playing. You can choose to answer the call or just keep doing what youre doing

-Device Sharing
&gt;Multiple users for phones. If you forget your phone, you still can call any of your friends (or access any of your messages, photos etc.) by simply logging into another Android phone running Lollipop. Also perfect for families who want to share a phone, but not their stuff
&gt;Screen pinning: pin your screen so another user can access just that content without messing with your other stuff

call, messages, photos simply by logging in? (cross device sync?)

-Connectivity
&gt;Improved network handoffs resulting in limited interruption in connectivity. For example, continue your video chat or VoIP calls without interruption as you leave the house and switch from your home Wi-Fi back to cellular

-OK Google
&gt;Even if your screen is off, you can say ""OK Google"" on devices with digital signal processing support such as Nexus 6 and Nexus 9
 
Basically touchless controls

-Accessibility
&gt;Adjust display to improve color differentiation

We keep comparing smartphone screens a lot (saturation levels and stuff). Will this put an end to it? 

-Device set up
&gt;Tap &amp; go: instant set up of your new Android phone or tablet by simply tapping it to your old one (requires NFC)

neat.

-And a whole lot more
&gt;Tap &amp; pay: easily manage multiple payment apps by quickly switching between them
&gt;Android Beam: lets you share a file with someone nearby by gently tapping the two devices together
&gt;Where supported by the hardware, your device will wake up as soon as you pick it up or tap the screen twice

TAP SCREEN TO WAKE! and as soon as you PICK IT UP. Features that moto and HTC offer are now in stock android :)

so is android beam going to let us share any type of file this time?

Tap and pay for 3rd parties: Since Google Wallet userbase isn't as vast as Paypal (maybe?), letting 3rd party payment apps like Paypal will let Android compete with Apple Pay directly maybe? (Paypal also mentioned it had plans for something like this)


Also something from the L page: 
&gt;Pick up where you left off
&gt;The songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches from one of your Android &gt;devices can be immediately enjoyed across all of your Android devices.

Could it be cross device sync for media? or just the play music streaming?

There seems to be active notifications built in for supported devices too ( Nexus 6 has it.

2021-08-25,1629909729,What Reddit app do you use? Why? [Mid-2021 Edition],"Hi! This is a follow up from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/f8tg1x/which_reddit_app_do_you_use_and_why_2020_edition/) previous one. 2020 and 2021 have been shaky years privacy-wise, considering Apple's tracker policy, external intervention in Reddit and expanding Chinese-manufacturer influence over the smartphone market. Perhaps some of these things have made you change apps or, otherwise, go back to the official one.

I've just been on the site for a couple of years and haven't tried many of the ones proposed by you last year, just the official one and Infinity. Could you tell me (an whoever finds this in the future) why are you using the one you currently have installed?

2017-10-04,1507145735,I feel that 2018 will be the end of the headphone jack for flagship Android phones,"After watching today's Google presentation and confirming what the leaks say about the Pixel 2 (both sizes), it seems like the trend is finally here, and it's that Google themselves are not using the headphone jack anymore for the Pixel 2.

We know that Apple started the mainstream trend without a headphone jack with the iPhone 7. It sold well, it's probably Apple's best selling phone thus far (if not best selling, then at least we know about Apple's importance in the smartphone market).

Now with the Pixel 2, Google's store is getting hammered by preorders on both units with a current-flagship specs and new Google stuff like Google Lens, without the jack.

This may be an alarming trend for the headphone jack diehard/users, as this is signaling to the companies that the masses don't really care that much about the headphone jack, despite loud noises from smartphone websites and users.

We still have Samsung, LG, Sony and Huawei who are still producing phones that have the 3.5mm headphone jack. However, that's for their current lineup. With Google in the lead as Android's creator plus generally with the Pixel (or Nexus) line as an industry's standard with upcoming software features, these manufacturers may see that...hey, it's really not that big of a deal. And those iPhones/Pixel 2s are selling well (HTC already did the switch, but their stuff just aren't selling super well regardless, I feel)!

Without a headphone jack, Apple and Google are both making their wireless headphones as a result (or if you're cynical, they removed the headphone jacks so their wireless headphones can sell). This also would likely mean that the other companies are looking at this and see that they can also make their own headsets - what's preventing them from doing it? What if the upcoming Samsung bluetooth wireless headset thingy will work great with the Galaxy S9/Note 9/Gear 3 or 4 with instant pairing (even better, if it's proprietary and only works with Samsung products). It also gives them an additional source of income.

I feel (or fear, rather) that starting in 2018's mainstream flagships, we won't see the headphone jacks anymore. This also means that with more smartphones forgoing the headphone jack, there will be a demand for more lightning/USB C headphones (or they just buy a bluetooth one). I predict that headphone companies will make a lightning and/or USB C headset for real starting in late 2018 (or a 3.5mm with free dongles to switch to these two adapters) to adapt to the market trend as a result. If you want to go one step further, this trend may actually eat into the computer speaker/hifi/audiophile market where lightning/USB C ports would pop up in these devices (and I don't even want to think about going from one universal standard to 3 standards or more just to listen to music, plugged).

And that's pretty sad. It's been known that the 3.5mm has been with us for our entire lives, and lived even longer than this. I personally don't think smartphones should lose this feature (because now charging your phone and listening with wired earphones simultaneously is a feature), but I'm not from Apple or Google's engineering team, product development or marketing team. Manufacturing cost is definitely a concern when you make millions of phones, and you're a multinational company that has tens of thousands of employees to pay every month, and factory costs and whatnot. But at the cost of your consumer...then that's harder to justify to the average user. But people are still buying these en masse and I don't know if it's consumerism at play or is it just really a tech cycle where things just phase out.

I do think that the midrange and lower-tier phones will keep the 3.5mm jack however, at least in 2018. They need to target the users who don't have that money to change their headsets or earphones, or just don't want to bother with bluetooth. And these phones would be great in non-first world country markets where these latest technology stuff aren't that common yet.

So all in all...it's mostly what I feel about what the next flagships are going to be. I might be wrong, maybe Samsung/LG/Sony sees that they do have a difference and a selling point to users who still need it. And I would be more than happy to be wrong and get the choice to have the headphone jack in 2018. But I think it's not going to be good.",Android,311,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/74akqu/i_feel_that_2018_will_be_the_end_of_the_headphone/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2023-11-12,1699786723,S23 long term review from an old school user,"Quite a few months have passed since release, but I'm pretty sure this phone is going to stay relevant in 2024 as well, so this review may be useful to some. Gotta warn though that my experience may not be applicable for many.

I've been a smartphone user since 2005 or something. I've seen things get better and worse. My requirements may differ from what an average user wants from their phone today (which obviously results in modern smartphones not being a good fit for me), so I decided to provide a different point of view.

I think I could be called a phone enthusiast in the past, flashing alternative firmwares and even trying to make my own at one point. But that is in the past, today I want a phone that just works, and I don't care much about the looks anymore.

I wasn't going to upgrade anytime soon, but an unfortunate road bump turned my LG Wing from a dual screen phone into a single screen one. So I found myself in a market for a new phone, with some pretty simple requirements - a decent camera, a decent battery, good support.

Obviously, there are no phones that fit these requirements, but a couple come close - Asus ZenFone 9 and Samsung Galaxy S23. The former did have better battery life and a couple minor advantages (better design, a plastic back, a side button fingerprint reader, a 3.5 mm jack), but the S23 beat it in terms of price, camera performance, support length, availability, warranty (the ZF9 was only sold by private sellers who had imported it illegally), overall performance and probably other stuff I have forgotten to mention. So the choice was obvious.

It was quite pricey, but I got the 256 Gb version, plus the extended Samsung Care warranty and a fast charger as a gift. But now it's time to get to the point.

Good:

* The camera is really nice. I can't claim that the difference between it and my previous phones is dramatic, but it works well, and sometimes is slightly better, especially when it comes to video.

* The firmware is nice, everything is convenient and while I have troubles recalling any special features at the moment, I can remember thinking ""well, that's neat"" more than a few times.

* The screen is great, readable even in bright light.

* They've finally got the ergonomics more or less right. My first Samsung phone was the Note 9, and it was a hell of accidental button presses and an inconveniently located fingerprint scanner. Now they've got the side buttons more or less where they should be (though using them for activating the camera shutter usually results in fingers getting in the frame), and the screen fps is located conveniently.

* The screen fps is great, much better than the one in my Wing and on par with the best physical fps I've tried. Plus the face unlock feature is neat, although nowhere near my iPad Pro.

* I can rely on it being updated for years to come.

The okay stuff:

* OneUI doesn't look that good. But who cares, especially since stock Android isn't as nice as it used to be either.

* It's definitely more manageable than some of my previous phones (Note 9, Wing), but still way outside of what I consider the goldilocks zone for a 180 cm guy when it comes to phone width.

* The battery life is okay. Nothing to write home about (I've been spoiled by Xperia Z1C and XZ2C), but it's good enough to last a day.

The bad stuff:

* Samsung still hasn't fixed Google Maps navigation with display off. I had this issue on my Note 9, I still have it on the S23: when I turn off the display and use audio directions, Maps lose access to GPS after a few minutes and I have to unlock it again. It's super annoying when cycling or walking. It may or may not have been solved in OneUI 6 which I'm downloading right now as I'm typing it.

* The dialer and the SMS app suck, they are as counterintuitive and limited as it gets. Of course, they can be easily replaced, but I'm too lazy to look for a replacement, SMS is dead and 95% of calls are in messenger apps these days anyway. Update: turns out the SMS app I was using was the Google one, I just switched to Samsung messages and it works as expected.

This phone is also full of gimmicks I didn't find useful, but thankfully I don't have to use them.

Overall I'm really happy with the S23, planning to use it for at least 3-4 years, probably with a battery replacement at some moment. I suspect that next year in most cases the best advice what to buy would be a refurbished/used S23.",Android,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/17thymb/s23_long_term_review_from_an_old_school_user/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

I was excited about the Moto X after checking out it's size and the touchless voice features. I love Google now and the idea of activating it with my voice is amazing. 

I've had it for an little while now and I'm going to randomly list some impressions on the device, I'll be happy to answer any questions. 

* The form factor is pretty fantastic, it feels wonderful in hand.
* The display is good, not great and amazing, but good.
* I love software buttons so much, especially with a black front and AMOLED.
* Touchless Google now is just everything I wanted it to be, Love it.
* The camera seems pretty shit.

2025-03-04,1741077453,Zenfone 12 Ultra: The Most Decent Phone Nobody is Going to Buy.,"Alright, hear me out on this one... the ROG Phone 9 is arguably one of the top high-performance smartphones out right now. The biggest drawback: probably the lack of an even minimally-acceptable camera system.

So what happens when you take the ROG Phone's top-of-the-line performance, long battery life, one of the only 3.5mm jacks in a flagship smartphone, and a dedicated gaming mode  and you give it a camera setup that's actually usable?

The Asus Zenfone 12 Ultra: one of the most-hated (or maybe most-ignored) flagships out right now.

I get it. Asus customer service sucks, it's as expensive as a Samsung, the camera still lags behind other flagships, you expect 7 years of feature updates for a phone that sells a tiny fraction of what other brands do, you still want a mini phone even though they haven't been selling, you could buy a phone from a Chinese company for $500... and so on.

But for the right person (definitely not everyone), I think it's still worth a look. If you're willing to accept that at this point, Android OS ""updates"" are basically unsubstantive except for a couple new gimmicky AI features tacked on top each year, then you'll be glad to hear that this phone offers:

- 5 years of software support (but only 2 official version updates)
- Snapdragon 8 Elite
- 5500 mah battery w/ 65W wired charging 
- 3.5mm headphone jack in 2025
- 50MP main camera + 32MP telephoto + 13MP ultra wide
- A suite of AI features that can be run on-device instead of in the cloud
- Up to 144hz refresh rate
- One of the cleanest, ""stock"" feeling Android skins (with just enough random features to make it feel unique)
- Incredible battery usage control (did I mention that 3.5mm jack? You can keep your Bluetooth off, and even charge while you plug in your headphones)

As a current Zenfone 10 owner I've honestly loved my phone. Do other phones have better cameras? Sure, but they can't make it through two days on a single charge. The whole one-handed phone experience has been incredibly convenient, but I can't say I'd be mad if I had to watch videos on a reasonably larger screen. I think part of me is a little frustrated that for how damn fast this phone is, it would be stupid to game on such a tiny screen.

""Android device makers, likeÂ Samsung, have included fingerprint unlocking technology in buttons on the sides of their phones for years""

It's kinda unfortunate that Samsung got mentioned first but it was Sony who popularized the side-mounted fingerprint reader in [2015](https://www.androidcentral.com/setting-and-using-fingerprint-scanner-sony-xperia-z5)! Now, Xiaomi, Motorola and others are utilizing the side mounted fp readers in their new phones. 

Some of the popular features that we take for granted in Android has been introduced/popularized by Sony like IP-water resistance (as [early as 2013 in Xperia Z](https://techland.time.com/2013/07/10/sony-xperia-z-review/) , extra-tall displays, Stamina mode for battery longevity, 960fps recording etc.. Also, Sony has contributed so much to the Android AOSP and features such as[ Android theming](https://www.androidcentral.com/waiting-dawn-new-android-theming-era)  and [high res Bluetooth audio ](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15004562/sony-google-android-o-ldac-wireless-music) was borne out of Sony's contributions. 

Hopefully, more Android makers will adopt Sony's [charge and play](https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-gaming-feature-charge-and-play-without-degrading-battery-health-h-s-power-control/amp/) battery mode, as it will help the battery.

2017-05-07,1494137916,Difference in the smartphone culture in India and the US.,"Ok, so in the last few months where I have been browsing through this subreddit a lot, I have noticed some very clear differences in how people in my country (India) and people in US use/need features and, overall, their Android. I find these differences fascinating. English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, I may be wrong in my assumptions, so feel free to correct me and explain :)Â 


First off, preferred phone size. People here, and in China too I guess, love huge phones. 5.5"" is pretty common, with 6"" phones also selling very well, though some people like me prefer 5"". But anything smaller than that is considered 'tiny'. Whereas I have seen many westerners here constantly asking for 4.5"" phones, for ease of use. Do people in the US watch movies on their phones? Do they have smaller hands? Also, are smaller phones only a requirement of a few redditors, or is this a common thing among the Android users? Please note that I'm asking these questions out of pure curiosity.Â 


Second, sms usage. I have seen this discussion quite a lot of times, especially along the lines of Allo-Whatsapp-iMessage. Sms is something we don't actively use for personal communication anymore. Its just there for notifications from banks, getting OTPs, and such. We use primarily Whatsapp and FB Messenger for communication here. Sms fallback (like iMesaage) is not something we want because sms is quite expensive here, and frankly, we just don't use sms much anymore. I think i understand this difference pretty well, but explanation about something I might have missed is welcome.Â 


Third, budget tier smartphones. Maybe its just reddit, but I get the impression that flagship phones are the most popular ones in the US. India is a huge market for budget smartphones because, lets face it, India is indeed an economically backward country. But the budget section I'm talking about is the sub-15k (around $230), with phones like Redmi 3S, Redmi Note 3, Lenovo Vibe K5 and its Note version, Samsung Galaxy J3, J5, J7, and not about OP3T and similarly priced phones. 20k+ (around $310) are not considered budget here, they are considered expensive. As for the Pixel, I have yet to see a Pixel XL here. So it's not popular at all. How much is that section popular in western countries? I have heard a few things about BLU smartphones.Â 


Fourth, dual sims. In India, dual sim is a must have feature for most people, students and professionals alike. I myself have two phones, both dual sims. So I have actually four numbers. This is fairly common. If a phone is not dual sim, it won't sell much. Whereas from some comments on Reddit I have seen in passing, I think dual sim is not really a common trend in the US. People still carry two phones with one sim each, one for professional and other for personal use. Why is it so? What are the contributing factors?

Edit : Since a lot of people are asking why I need four sims, let me clarify. I actually don't need 4,I'm keeping two extra just because I can and there is negligible maintenance cost involved. I (and most Indians) use prepaid. We 'reacharge' our numbers with, let's say, 100 rupees, and it gives me around 90 credits. Now I can use this credit to buy data, specific plans with limited validity, or I can just use it to call with the default call rates applying. Or I can just leave it be, and it'd remain there for months, sometimes years. 
Also, I chose 100 rupees as an example. I can also use 10 rupees' recharge. 1$ is around 60-65 Indian rupees. So with 1$, I'm set for months, or even years. 
Â Now why I and several other people here use two sims. Without any extra expenditure. And since data packs and calling packs are seperate, the bill actually gets lower. For example, Telenor's call rates are dirt cheap, but its data speed is bad. On the other hand, Airtel has good data speeds, but its call rate is way more than Telenor's. So many people use Telenor for calling and Airtel for data, getting the best of both without shelling out double the money.

2022-08-05,1659684507,"The differentiation of phones into a regular, Pro, Ultra/Pro Max has been one of the worst things to happen in the smartphone world","Companies unnecessarily gimp and cripple their regular models so that the phones higher in value sell more. It was fine when this differentiation was limited to maybe smaller screen size or a smaller battery or maybe skipping OIS etc. But now even the core essentials are being compromised. For example the latest OnePlus 10T is throttled so much that you can get Snapdragon 888 type performance in regular mode (Source:Gsm arena) only so that it doesn't eclipse the Pro model. Similarly other compromises are being made in build and design , quality of materials (cheap fingerprint scanner in Pixel 6a) and so on. 
Hopeful that some sense gets knocked into these companies and at least they do the basics right in phone

2014-10-06,1412592540,In defense of flashlight apps...,"Hey fellow redditors,
I've been a daily visitor of this sub for a very long time. Also, I'm the developer of one of the popular flashlight apps on the play store. 

In the last several days a ""counterveillance"" company claimed that the top 10 flashlight apps are stealing private data and sell it to countries like Russia, Iran, etc.

Here's the first post
http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2i0467/most_flashlight_apps_on_android_steal_your_data/

And this is the second one from yesterday
http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2id82z/the_top_10_flashlight_apps_are_all_sending_your/

First, I decided to ignore all this, but several redditors said that if the flashlight developers don't do the stuff described in the report they should come and say so.
And here I am. My app doesn't have access to personal data. It doesn't sell personal data to 3rd world countries and doesn't work with unknown companies with unknown background.


Now to the technical details...
The ""counterveillance"" company's main argument is that these apps have a long list of permissions accessing different information provided by the OS and thus they must be selling this information to 3rd parties. 
As many redditors noticed in the comments, the report didn't include information whether they even tried to check the data that was coming out of these apps. How did they decide that there was any personal data involved? How did they find that this data was sold to 3rd world countries? 

I believe that most other flashlight apps like mine are clear of all this stuff. Of course there are a couple of exceptions with a huge permissions list, which I, as a developer, find it hard to explain. These apps are easily spotted and they don't really need to be flashlight apps. You can find such apps in every category. 

Since most of you guys are not developers, it's completely normal to not understand the permissions and wonder how they are used. Here's a detailed overview of all permissions in my app. You will see a similar list in almost all other flashlight apps, because a feature rich app cannot go without this minimal set of permissions.

* take pictures and video (this is the CAMERA permission). Used to activate the camera flash. 

* control flashlight. I'm still supporting Android 1.5 and 1.6 and back in the old days on some devices (moto backflip) the camera flash was activated via a private API, which required this permission.

* full network access - used for showing ads from Google's Admob

* view network connections - again for Google's Admob. This permission allows the ads code to detect whether you are on wifi or data. If you are on data the ad requests will be reduced to save you bandwidth.

* control vibration - some users want the device to vibrate, when they toggle the light

* prevent the device from sleeping - very important permission for a flashlight app. In my app you can turn on the camera flash and then hit the power button of the device to turn off the screen. It's very handy, because you can hold your device like a real flashlight without hitting any buttons on the screen. Without this permission, the device will fall in ""deep"" sleep when you hit the power button and the light would turn off. Also, if you are using the screen light you don't want your device to turn off while you are doing something important.


The second argument of the ""counterveillance"" company is that a flashlight app must not exceed 73 kilobytes in size. An application, which exceeds this size must contain code, which does some very bad things.
In reality, you can't squeeze a high-quality application in less than several megabytes. In my app, only the launch icons for several screen DPIs are more than 100kb and that's in case you don't have any other images, which is almost impossible to create a good looking app without. Then you have code for functionality - in my case it's almost 400kb,
which contains the basic LED functions with workarounds for many different devices, support for LED and screen strobe, widgets, plugins system for additional functionality, accessibility, restricted accounts support.
Then you have support for tablets, which is a whole different beast and 3rd party libraries like the Google Play services, which is used to show ads - another 300kb.


Another argument that I saw by the company is that if you use Google Ads in your application you are giving indirectly your user's data to Google.
Yes, this is always a possibility (if the developer is using permissions, which can access personal data), but don't you think there is an easier way for Google to get to your data? For example, when you activate you Google powered device with your Google account.


Another thing that most users don't realize is that we, the popular developers, are under constant pressure from law authorities. We do realize that the users' privacy is something very important.
My application has almost 250 million downloads and I'm not hiding behind some company name. I have my real name in Google Play and I live in a country, which is a part of the EU, where the privacy information laws are very strict.
What do you think would happen if I decide to take my user's data and sell it to someone in a country like Russia, a state we are almost at war with? They will send me to a place where I won't be allowed to take my smartphone with me...

Best take, The new editor, audio eraser, video boost, 7 year support, etc. Not mentioning the fact that pixels often have the best camera and no third-party bloat (unlike Samsung and Xiaomi).

A lot of tech enthusiasts (especially on reddit) are obsessed over the fact that the numbers don't match the latest flagships, which I agree, is a very valid concern. But it is not in the slightest bit relevant when the features provided outweigh the competition in uniqueness and usefulness.

An average user couldn't care less if a phone scores 1000 abstract points less on an XYZbenchmark. But they will care if a phone can take a great photo or create social media edits easily.

Edit: And just like that, the ""techies"" misses the point entirely. Referring to a previous comment:

&gt;I am not trying to defend the P8's limitations. The reason I mentioned is because of the innovative features in AI and the leading 7 year support that are far more valuable to the whole industry (and individual users) than raw performance numbers.

&gt;Another example is the Nothing Phone (1) was overpriced at launch with mid range specs but it bought a refreshing design to the smartphone world.

2021-08-02,1627921345,Pixel 6 pre-release information megathread,"**Twitter mirror**

&gt;Here's a sneak peek at the newest Google Phones powered by Google Tensor - the brand new chip designed by Google, custom-made for Pixel. 

&gt;Meet:

&gt;=Ã± \#Pixel6

&gt;=Ã± \#Pixel6 Pro

&gt;Both are coming later this year.

&gt;Well tell you a little about them in this>Ãµ=G

&gt;(1/13)

[Source](https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1422226005339557889)

&gt;Lets start outside and work our way in. 

&gt;\#Pixel6 Pro will come in three color combos.

&gt;\#Pixel6 has three color combos too.

&gt;Pro tip (ha!) - the Pixel phones with more space above the camera bar = #Pixel6 Pro

&gt;Hello =Ã· bar!

&gt;\#Pixel6 Pro has 3 cameras, including a telephoto lens with a 4x optical zoom.

&gt;\#Pixel6 has the same great cameras as #Pixel6 Pro, just no telephoto. Were leaving telephoto to the pros, you could say =	

&gt;(3/13)

&gt;Hey, were just going to call it #Pixel6 for the rest of this >Ãµ, but we mean both #Pixel6 and #Pixel6 Pro. Cool? Cool.

&gt;(4/13)

&gt;We made a chip!

&gt;\#Pixel6 is powered by our first ever smartphone SoC: meet Google Tensor

&gt;(5/13)

&gt;The highlight of Tensor is that it can process Googles most powerful AI and ML models directly on #Pixel6.

&gt;Youll see a transformed experience for the camera =Ã·, speech recognition =Ã£ and many other Pixel 6 features.

&gt;(6/13)

&gt;Switching Â™ a bit. Lets talk speech.

&gt;Speech recognition is another foundational technology where you will see a huge improvement in #Pixel6. 

&gt;Google Tensor allows us to make big leaps in:

&gt;Voice commands
&gt;Translation
&gt;Captioning
&gt;&amp; Dictation

2022-07-06,1657124626,Categorisation of smartphones based on Pricing (and Features).,"So I decided to do a fun classification of phones based on their price. Do note that i am not a an expert and this is not to be taken too seriously ;) 

Categories.

+ Flagship
+ Sub-flagship
+ Premium
+ Upper-Midrange
+ Lower-Midrange
+ Budget

___

- **Flagships : $1000 and above**

These are the absolute top tier, cutting edge phones from a brand.

 Examples :

Galaxy S22 Ultra,
Oppo Find X5 Pro,
 iPhone 13 Pros

- **Sub-flagships : $800-$1000**

These phones usually belong to the flagship series of a brand, but are not the highest end phone in the series.

Examples: vanilla S22 / S22+ , iPhone 13/ 13 mini, Oneplus 10 Pro

- **Premium : $600-$800**

When you move down to this category you see phones deviate from being a flagship. They still may have several flagship features, but imo they can't be called flagships whatsoever.

Examples : Goggle Pixel 6, Galaxy S21 FE

- **Upper-midrange : $450-$600**

These phones are, obviously midrangers with juicy specs. 

Examples: One plus Nord 2T, Google Pixel 5a, Galaxy A52/A72

- **Lower-midrange : $300-$450**

These phones have less beefier specs than upper midrangers. However, they are still not the cheapest or worst phones you can buy.

Examples : Galaxy A33, Nord CE 2

- **Budget : $300 and below**

These phones are very affordable, lack premium features and qualitatively at the bottom rung.

Examples : Galaxy A03, Galaxy A12, Nord N200

___


Note: Flagship killers and most value oriented Chinese phones ( Poco, Redmi, Real men etc..) cannot be strictly put into categories considering only their price, due to their high ratio of specs-price.

Note#2 : I will continue to edit and improve this post.

Edit: Added new category ""Premium"". Adjusted prices of Upper-midrange and lower midrange.


That's it!

2017-11-14,1510641995,What features honestly wow'd you when it came to budget smartphones?,"So as the title suggests this is a discussion of what makes a good, budget smartphone. I am asking because a lot of people in my friend group (even some that work in software engineering) can't really agree on what features they are looking for in a budget smartphone to make it adequate enough for either casual use or hardcore enthusiasts. As for myself, I am using the Honor 6x (as my flair would suggest) and I am completely satisfied with what I got for a mere $200. I paid for it in full, which means I own the damn thing, AND it does all the things that major flagships can do at a much lower cost. I converted to the Android darkside after using an iPhone 6 plus for so long and I have to say that there are many things that the 6 plus is missing. SURE...I am comparing devices that are years apart, but there are so many things that I rave about with this phone; the camera takes some of the better cellphone photos that I have seen in a while. It's not the best, but when you know how to use it the camera is fantastic. The fingerprint sensor is lightning fast, AND it can double as an input device while using the device! (I currently use it to draw down my notifications drawer, it makes one handed operation a lot easier for me personally) I love the display, I can't tell what type it is but it works great and seems to get a lot brighter than my iPhone ever did. 

I know what I am saying here should be taken with a grain of salt but for $200 I think I got a great deal and I can't imagine what phone would have been better at this price range. Thoughts? What features are you guys looking into when it comes to the ""budget"" smart device?

2017-02-05,1486312874,"[DEV] I've made ""Joey for Reddit"", an android client for Reddit. I would love some feedback from you guys.","Hello, fellow r/Android members,

I have released ""Joey for Reddit"", an unofficial android client for Reddit.

 [Google Play Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=o.o.joey)

**How it started**


I like to read AMAs at r/IAmA but reading them was pain. I searched google play for apps for AMA, but couldn't find one. I started developing an app exclusively for AMA. While developing, I thought about other ways in which the user experience can be improved for other content of reddit, and I kept adding those features, and now we have a full client for Reddit.


**[Video Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF41z5fd7U8)**

**What makes Joey different?**

* Designed bottom up for AMAs
  1. **Read AMAs in magazine style question answer format**. [See pic](http://i.imgur.com/1czjMfs.png). [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0wesvwL0Tw).
  1. Read AMA category wise. Say if you want to read, only gaming AMA right now. [See pic](http://i.imgur.com/m1igDlY.png).

* Designed for comments.
  1. **See all the ancestors of a comment, with the siblings of ancestor comments collapsed**.[See Pic](http://i.imgur.com/zNBLLdi.png). [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYMbRg8BKvI).
  1. A comment navigator that works with collapsed comments.
  1. Ability to collapse the thread from any comment.



*  Designed for albums : In current clients, we generally have to swipe horizontally to flip through photos and vertically to read the description of the photos. 
  1. Joey has Vertical Cards for albums: swipe only in one direction. It also has in-place zoom. [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQh86oIBjB4).



* Optimized for r/science : 
  1. Read the posts category wise. [See pic](http://i.imgur.com/jfDOSgI.png). 
  1. Add upcoming AMA to you calendar.
* Optimized for r/askscience : 
  1. Read the question category wise. [See pic](http://i.imgur.com/Mo4bm2J.png).

* Optimized for r/LifeProTips : 
  1. Read LPTs topic wise. [See pic](http://i.imgur.com/qAg6fac.png).

* Real trophy-case for your Reddit trophies :) [See pic](http://i.imgur.com/U0y7E2U.png).




Other non - exclusive features:

* Day night theme, with AMOLED variant.
* Customizable font and font size.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

I will try to match all the features that you would miss from other clients, so that Joey becomes your goto app for Reddit. :)

PS : **NSFW is off by default**. You can turn it on, from Settings-&gt;Filters-&gt;Show NSFW.

PPS : English is not my first language, pardon my mistakes.

2014-10-10,1412925732,"With all the hype of the Z3 Compact, here's some negative points from a Z3C owner for sake of balance","Some are minor points, some are negative stuff that is present in other mobiles also so it's hard to avoid.

- The flat glass back makes it slippery, dangerously slippery. I didn't know my PC desk was slanted, but now i know because the phone slid of while being on it. It also slipped of a table because the charger cable was pulling on it slightly and it vibrated when i got a call. Definitely needs a case or a texture back stickers. Note that cases can make using magnetic charger harder or impossible.

- Mine and some others seems to have bad reception with WIFI on, better with it OFF. Some reports of the phone having worse reception than their old phones (for ex old nexuses, Galaxy S3/mini etc). Could hopefully be a firmware problem, otherwise I'm pissed.

- If you unlock the bootloader you lose features like low-light camera (which to a degree affects every shot depending on). I was hoping to root my phone but i am on the fence now, since i like the low camera mode. Hopefully the popularity of the phone will make the custom community for the phone active and we either get a root exploit method that saves the features.

- The magnetic charger accessories are weak in their original/cheap copy form. You'd have to buy some kind of stronger version to get what you probably are hoping for, something that sticks like a strong magnet to a fridge. Now they mostly stay in place if you let the phone be, and the dock isn't snapping the phone to place without some fidgeting. It's like he weakest magnet you have on your fridge that barely holds up a paper sadly. 

- There are some intrusive Xperia apps that give notifications when they feel like. There is also a ""whats new"" app from Sony that is placed with Google now on the home button swipe, making it easy to accidentally press if you swipe up. Can be disabled with adb.

- The speakers are loud, but also very ""rumbly"" and flat. The whole back vibrates when you play anything at decent volume. The low vibration/rumbling at lower volumes are ok but the vibration of the back at higher volumes can be annoying. It's a shame it couldn't handle mid volumes better without vibrating. The volume is on par with my HTC One m7 front speakers but the quality is not. The overall volume is good though and works well in for example a loud car, not so much for music listening imo. 

- The double tap to wake feature doesn't seem to be better than any previous implementation. If your pants/thighs (for example during cycling) are slightly wet and the screen is faced towards you, it will accidentally wake up the phone by my experience. I think the right implementation is HTCs swipe to wake, as that is harder to do accidentally.

- Anyone else have any points?

It's a pretty short list overall, there's a few point more but those are mostly my personal preferences. So it is a very good phone, i just think these points are something that might affect any user so they should be brought up, it isn't a 100/100 phone that lacks any problem.

2016-10-09,1475977452,Do you feel Android's reputation isn't as good as Google wanted it to be? Which is why they are marketing their new phone as Google phone?,"With the Pixel keynote available, I noticed Google wasn't associating itself with Android as it was as a Google experience.

IMO, the biggest selling feature of a Pixel phone is its software experience, which happens to be Android. Yet Google is marketing this phone not as an Android phone, but as a Google phone.

2013-11-28,1385679962,I developed an app and created a starting guide for you to learn how to do the same. I hope it helps!,"For the last 4 months I have been working on my first Android app. It took some work to navigate the Android SDK and learn how it uses some key programming concepts. But I collected a lot of useful resources in the process that I hope can be of help to others as well. In this post I will try to put these resources together and lay out a starting guide for those who are interested in creating their first app.

Here is the tl;dr guide:

 -  If you are starting from scratch, first get the Android SDK here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
 
 - If you are really starting from scratch, you should actually learn Java first
  
 - Then consider starting with the following video tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z149x12sXsw This is a great series that will guide you through the basics of an Android app. I recommend that you not only watch the video but repeat what he is doing simultaneously.
  
 - A great companion book is [The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development](http://commonsware.com/Android/). If you don't want or can't buy the book, consider looking at its many code examples available for free at: https://github.com/commonsguy/cw-omnibus/
   
 - Learn how to search for solutions before you ask questions
   
 - Learn how to debug your code
   
 - Once you learn the basics, invest some time in understanding some key concepts: configuration changes, usage of threads and broadcast receivers, usage of the support library, and the implementation of Parcelable
   
 - Your friends can be a great source of help and feedback. Ask kindly, do not harass them.
   
 - Unless your app is the next big thing since sliced bread, do not bother too much with announcing it before it's ready. There are too many ""pre-apps"" out there, nobody cares.

If you are now interested in reading the full guide, thank you for your attention. You can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19uj9TS0Hzaxyv8IM1D20d23GdU9aAkXo5BYfL15VG0I/edit?usp=sharing). Below is a summary of it, condensed within the character limits of this post.

# **What to Learn First**
 
If you never programmed at all before or if you are interested in some basic information, consider looking at these first:
 
  - [Java Language Fundamentals] (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Language_Fundamentals)
  - [Dealing with Exceptions] (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Exceptions)
  - [Understanding Threads and Runnables] (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Threads_and_Runnables)
  - [Using Interfaces] (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Interfaces)
  - [Using Event Listeners] (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/intro.html)
  - [Creating your own Callbacks and Listeners] (http://stackoverflow.com/a/1477229/362298)
  
Understanding the concepts is a good thing because it lets you search for practical ways to achieve something. Almost everything you can think of doing has already been tried and documented by someone else. You just need to know how to find it. Which leads me to my next set of things you may consider to learn first:
 
  - Learn how to search. I cannot stress this enough. Seriously, just Google it. If you are stuck or in doubt, search for your question. And most of all: Search before you ask.
  - Learn how to debug your code. There is a surprisingly high number of learners who do not debug their code at all and can't really [understand their code's log](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6065258/how-to-interpret-logcat). If you are using Eclipse,  [check this out] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551818/how-to-debug-android-application-line-by-line-using-eclipse).
  
Speaking of Eclipse, the IDE most people still use to program for Android, whether you want to use it or not is up to you. Bear in mind the following though:

   - The alternative IDE most people talk about, Android Studio (which is based on IntelliJ), is still in an **early access** preview. The official Android page has the [following warning about it](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html): ""Android Studio is currently available as an early access preview. Several features are either incomplete or not yet implemented and you may encounter bugs.""
   - Most tutorials and documentation for beginners are still based on the use of Eclipse. All the resources I talk about here which are connected to an IDE, refer to Eclipse.
 
*
# **Android Resources for Beginners**
 
With the basics in mind, it is time to start coding your first Android app. To begin, download and install the [Android Developer Tools] (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). Then consider the following tutorials and resources:
 
  - [The Android official training guides](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html) are a good place to start. The [Building Your First App](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) lesson is very easy to follow  and already gives you a good understanding of some key concepts of the Android SDK.
  
  - [The Android Development Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z149x12sXsw) by Derek Banas is great for those of you who prefer video lessons. It has 25 video lessons in total ranging from 10 to 30 minutes each. I used the first lessons to get a feel of the development process, specially to understand layouts.
  
  - [Common tasks](http://developer.android.com/guide/faq/commontasks.html) are a useful list of typical things you can do in your app and how to develop them.
  
  - [Android Guides](https://github.com/thecodepath/android_guides/wiki) give you even more explained code recipes and examples on how to build most common things in an Android app. I wish this was published when I started learning. It would have certainly helped.
  
  - [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en) is a great app available on the Google Play Store. You probably have heard of it. This app won't teach you anything about how to develop Android apps but it will show you what an Android app can do with your phone. I learned a lot from it. Whenever I realised I wanted to do something specific, I knew I could do it because I had done it before on Tasker.
  
  - [DevAppsDirect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inappsquared.devappsdirect&amp;hl=en) is another great app you can get from the Play Store. While it also won't teach you how to develop an app, it will show you what is available out there. The app maintains a list of open source libraries you can use in your project for a variety of purposes. Knowing what you can reuse will save you a lot of time in the future.
  
In addition, my favorite book is by far [The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development](http://commonsware.com/Android/). The book is comprehensive with its over 2,400 pages but starts with the basics, explaining the concepts. It also has those ""do-it-yourself"" tutorials to help you retain what you are learning. The book is a bit expensive but it comes with a one-year subscription to keep it updated during the period.

All code examples are free and can be found here:  https://github.com/commonsguy/cw-omnibus/ Even if you don't buy the book, consider browsing through some of the examples there to learn how other programmers do things. Finally, Mark Murphy, the author of the book, is helpful whether you contact him by e-mail or on the [Stackoverflow website](http://stackoverflow.com/). Check out [his profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware). He is in the all time top-10 ranking list there.

# Publishing and Advertising your app
 There is [a great guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1lgbh7/advice_for_all_new_devs_intending_to_publish_to/) here on Reddit explaining how to publish your app on the Play Store.
 
 Regarding advertising, there are tons of books, blog posts, discussions and what not out there trying to tell you what to do to advertise your app. Here is what I am doing.
 
 I did announce my app last month before it was ready. I had one of those ""coming soon"" templates with some screenshots of it. The goal was mainly to use this page to advertise the app on web sites dedicated to announce the release of new apps. The places I tried include:
 
  - [Betali.st](http://betali.st/)
  - [Launching next](http://launchingnext.com/)
  - [Pre-apps](http://www.preapps.com/)
  
There are many others you can consider but from my experience with these, I wouldn't bother. There are too many apps being listed in those sites and competition for attention is fierce. So far, I got more attention from my posts on Facebook to my friends. 
 
I am now paying for ads on Facebook but that doesn't seem to be working well either. Facebook gives you an estimate of how many ""likes"" you will get per day. In my case that estimate was between 5 and 19 likes. I am running the ad for the third day now and so far I got 6 likes that came from the ad. Not exactly a reliable estimate.

In the coming days I will try also Google Ad Words and ads here on Reddit. I will be glad to share the numbers with you once I get the results if you are interested. I don't know yet what to do once I get this information. I guess it will depend on how much feedback I get from the app's current release. Your suggestions are more than welcome if you have any.

# Wrapping up
  
  If you read until this far, thank you very much again. I hope I gave you some new and interesting information to work with. At the same time, I'm sure I'm missing tons of other stuff. If there is something you feel like I should include in this guide, please let me know in the comments. I will be glad to improve it.
  
  If you are interested, the app I developed is called [The Talker App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetalkerapp.main). I will be very happy if you could check it out and give me some feedback to improve it.
  
Thanks!

2019-04-09,1554777231,"Which ""axed"" Android feature do you miss?","So this post is partly about venting and partly hoping for someone with more of an understanding of software development to offer some cogent feedback.

So I've been reflecting in recent times on the trend of Android updates since the move from Kit Kat to Lollipop. One thing that I've noticed is that overtime updates have been improving the ""out of the box"" experience and overall visual simplicity of Android. The ""under-the-hood"" improvements have also been stellar (Pie's handling of background apps for instance has come leaps and bounds since Kit Kat) and I am grateful for all these things and would still happily take Android over IOS any day of the week.

With that said, I am constantly bothered by removal of features on a consistent basis. Some have been quite big such as the very useful feature of lockscreen widgets between Kit Kat to Lollipop. Some have been less obvious but still quite impactful for power users such as the removal of the ability to clear internal cache in the move from Nougat to Oreo or the removal of the battery preview in the extended quick settings somewhere between Nougat and Pie (don't recall whether the feature was still present in Oreo).

Now I understand the whole thought process of appealing to a greater audience through simplifying the UI and UX and making it more visually appealing (even though that's more of a subjective viewpoint but I digress). The thing that bothers me though is the question of whether there's an actual necessity for removing these features - some of which are so small that I don't even see the point of removing them. The customization freak in me really misses lockscreen widgets for instance. Now idk if this was a necessity in the switch to material design but I am absolutely stumped by why there would be a removal of a simple menu item that allows me to clean all my device cache in one click. 

I don't wanna ramble on for too long so I'll just wrap up by asking 2 questions. What feature do you miss from a prior feature of Android and why do you think it was removed?

The little preview icon in the Camera gallery circle shows it. You switch to Photos or some other app, and poof, it's not there. Switch back to Camera, and you can watch the preview actually disappear in front of your eyes and go back to the previous picture that did save.

It's been happening to me on the Pixel 2 XLs, but before I got the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, I saw this tweet from Daniel of Android Central calling out the problem on his Pixel 3: https://twitter.com/journeydan/status/1051988879874523137.

2016-07-07,1467904871,Dash SMS/Messenger - A Better Messaging Experience for Android,"Hey r/Android,

I'm the CTO of Dash Inc. We're a start-up company that's got a lot of experience using Android, loving Android, and occasionally, being frustrated by Android. Being an android developer and enthusiast for the past 6 years, I've always noticed how our messaging platform is fragmented, and while Google releases a different platform every few years, they never create the unified experience that users really need. Apple has iMessage and we don't have anything similar...so our team took it upon ourselves to design the app of our dreams. :)

I present to you, Dash SMS/Messenger. Dash is your one-stop shop for messaging. If your friends have Dash, it sends as an instant message (this means typing indicators, read receipts, instant delivery, the works). However, if your friends don't have Dash or you lose internet connection, you can send your message from within the same thread as an SMS or MMS. This means:

* No more switching apps constantly to message your friends, family, and colleagues.

* No more lagging behind in MMS groups with your iPhone friends.

* No more wishing that Android had a better messaging experience with a sleek interface, increased stability, and premium features.

Dash has a ton of cool features like a messaging toolbar that features thousands of gifs and stickerss. It also features reactions, which is a new feature that allows you to react to specific messages. You can tell your friends how you feel without having to type out a long message. Better yet, in a group of friends, you can get the opinions of all your friends without getting spammed with messages.

**Dash for Android is out as an open beta on the Google Play store. We invite you to access it at this link: https://goo.gl/lKeAdG** (open on your android phone to take you straight to the play store page. We've seen some users have problems opening it on their desktop. Make sure you're signed into the same google account you use on your phone).

Our Dash for iOS app is coming next month and allow you to Dash message your iPhone friends for free.

Keep in mind, we are still in open beta and our devs are fixing up bugs as fast as they can. We're working 24 hours a day to keep things running smoothly. If you have any ideas, questions, or bug reports, please send them to contact@dashapps.io. Thanks for being such an awesome community. I personally thank you so much for helping us out and I look forward to hearing from all of you!

**tl;dr: We created an app that works a lot like iMessage but on Android. It's in beta. We'd love for you to test: https://goo.gl/lKeAdG**

**UPDATE 12/17: DASH JUST LAUNCHED PUBLIC! Thank you so much to everyone who provided feedback. We have fixed the crashes (any crashes that appear will be fixed asap), fixed import (runs a quick 2-pass import on all conversations and happens in the background), and worked on making the app fast and stable.**",Android,742,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4rp3q0/dash_smsmessenger_a_better_messaging_experience/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2016-09-21,1474485443,Why SMS Fallback isn't the holy grail you all perceive it to be.,"SMS Fallback is possible on Android. It just won't work well on Android. (Even in the US)

It works well on IOS though. The reason it works on IOS is because:

1. IOS has a large market share and every iPhone since the launch of iMessage 5 years ago has access to this.

2. iMessage is forced integration where users don't have an option to use any SMS App.

3. iMessage has the same advantage as SMS. It is universal for everyone with a phone number (Atleast in the US)

4. iMessage is completely seamless. In the states, when you text/iMessage an IOS user, its guaranteed that the message will show up in their default messaging app, because everyone uses some combination of text/iMessage.

There is no possibility that the messages in the same conversation might be fragmented between messaging apps when switching from data to sms. 


Now Android is much different. It won't work because:

1. It isn't forced. Manufacturers can bundle any messaging app they want, and users can install/switch to any messaging app they want. Yes, Google can bundle Allo in every single phone there is, and have people register, but isn't the same.

2. Lets say for a second that Allo has SMS Fallback, the holy grail of all non-whatsapp /r/android users who live in the states. Lets say I'm using it to contact Matias.

Lets say Matias also has Allo installed, but with the spirit of android, he likes to use *insert other sms app* more. Now when I'm talking with him on Allo, while hes on a data connection the messages are going to be normal.

Now lets say I lose data connection, and one of us has to go to sms. Allo then switches to SMS. The text conversation is going to look perfectly normal on my side, because its completely seamless. Now what every /r/android user screaming for SMS fallback is missing is the fact that on Matias's side, my SMS messages are now going to show up in *insert sms app here*, instead of Allo, completely ruining his conversation and experience.

You could say that you should be forced to use SMS when using Allo, but that ignores everyone on IOS.

Now it brings up another problem: You now are forced to reply on SMS if you don't have a data connection/plan. That doesn't help the fragmentation problem one bit. What about if you want to reach that guy? Do you start with SMS and then switch to Allo once you get data? Sure power users might do that, but do you expect the average consumer to do that? No they'll just stick to SMS and not use Allo ever again.

On iMessage its different. since everyone uses the same app. If I'm on an iPhone and I lose data, and switch to SMS, Matias on an Android device isn't going to notice a thing. If Matias uses a iDevice, hes still not going to notice a thing as his messages stiill stay in the same conversation, they'll just change color.

Now yes, Allo can include an 10 billion options detecting whether the other guy has it as default SMS and then making messages to him be either all Allo or all SMS, etc etc etc, but Google isn't exactly the company to put 10 billion confusing options into their apps either. It'll be just as confusing to even power users.

**TL:DR. No, Allo having SMS Fallback isn't going to work as well as iMessage or even close, and Google knows this.**

**Person A has Allo, and has Allo as default SMS app. Person B has Allo, but uses FB Messenger as default SMS app.
Everything looks/works fine for person A.**

**For person B, if they don't have a data connection, the SMS will show up in a DIFFERENT app for them. This is a very confusing and hard to deal with scenario for the layman, and one that they likely will not know how to deal with. Will they respond in the SMS app, moving the conversation out of Allo? This is very likely.**

For more conversation on this, check out this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uod4/sms_fallback_is_a_technical_limitation_in_android/d7web4o

Common Questions:

&gt;**Q: What if Allo didn't work at all without it being the default SMS app, the way Messenger is. If you want to use Allo, you can only use it to its full potential.**

A: Yes, that would work for Android, but what about IOS? Google isn't going to limit 50% of their potential market.
Now if IOS supported alternative SMS apps, yes your idea would definitely work. IOS also wouldn't support that because then Apple would destroy the seamlessness that makes iMessage work so well

Lets say all that happened, now Google needs to convince every IOS user who wants to use Allo to also abandon the seamlessness of iMessage for a completely new platform that no one uses

&gt;**Q: The idea would be that the iOS imessage user would have a different experience than the Allo user. The same way the Android SMS user has a different experience than the iMessage user. Allo can be SMS default and both Allo messages and SMS would be on the same app. iOS imessage users would get the same green message like always.**

A: What if said IOS user loses data connection? Where will my messages go?

1. SMS into iMessage breaking the conversation into another app.

2. Wait til this guy gets data back and into Allo. Now SMS fallback is completely useless for half the Allo userbase. I also won't be able to reach this guy in time.

3. Just send every Allo message to an iPhone user into iMessage. That wouldn't work either because now Allo is completely and fucking useless on IOS

&gt;**Q: Make Allo Android only, and make it so you have to select Allo as default SMS to even use Allo at all.**

A: That would work, but do you think Google would ever do that? Sacrifice half their potential userbase for a risky iMessage competitor? Not to mention put every SMS app out of business.

Also this is Google, not Apple. Google doesn't force things down our throats.

&gt;**Q: Nobody's forcing him to use one app. He can use both Facebook messenger, Hangouts, Allo, and whatsapp for all I care, but it's his own fault that his messaging life is so fragmented. If Allo had SMS, it would be my choice messenger because I don't want to have to manage more than one messaging app.**

A: Why have this at all then? its just creating new problems that we don't have today just to kind of solve another problem.

Why force someone who is tech illiterate to have a worse experience, with messages appearing in different applications depending on his network status. Now hes just gonna move to apple.

&gt;**Q: Insert normal use case where Allo sms fallback works perfectly.**

A: Its the edge cases that make this such a problem to use. 

&gt;**Q: iPhone users can simply either use the app, and receive message from other Allo users through Allo as data connection allows, or not use it and get them in iMessage as standard text. I don't see a problem.**

A: And we're back to our original problem of conversations separated in two separate apps without context

2016-01-10,1452443442,Google needs to solve Android's inconsistent idle drain.,"Lollipop came with the promise of Project Volta for our batteries. It turns out this did little to nothing in real world usage, and instead we got the mobile radio active bug. 

Then Marshmallow came with Doze and App Standby. Credit is due here: it is, for the most part, a solid incremental improvement *when it actually kicks in.* Oh yeah, and now we have the Wifi drain bug too. Fun!

And that's the biggest problem with battery life on Android: the wild inconsistency. Sometimes it's as if my Nexus 7 forgets that Doze is a thing. *Some* mornings I wake up to find I lost only 2% of my battery overnight. *Other* mornings I wake up and I've somehow lost over 30%. My Nexus 6 is usually a little more reliable, but it too experiences these kinds of inconsistencies.

I recently and reluctantly purchased an iPad mini 4 after being unable to find an Android tablet that fit my stipulations, and despite my general dislike of iOS, my god, the reliable battery life is a welcome night and day difference. I can leave this thing sitting for a whole day and it's only lost 1%. If I leave it another day, it'll have lost another 1%. There's no telling what my Nexus 7's battery would look like if I picked it up after two days. It drives me crazy that Apple has had this figured out for so long and it's still such a messy, unpredictable situation on Android.

I'm not one of those people saying ""if Google doesn't solve this, I'm going to iPhone!"" -- I am an overwhelmingly huge fan of Android. But it's incredibly frustrating sometimes, not knowing whether my phone or tablet is going to have a ""good day"" or a ""bad day"" for battery life due to no particular user-facing reason or change in usage. 

Google seems content to try half-hearted solutions like Volta and Doze, which only works when you have your device sitting still and unused for a long period of time -- you know, because that's what a *mobile* device is for. What do you think can be done to solve this problem? How can Google make Android's idle battery usage comparable to that of iOS, or to at least give the *option* to the user to enable this if they value battery over added background functionality?",Android,280,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/40bxck/google_needs_to_solve_androids_inconsistent_idle/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2024-05-21,1716261838,Moved from Android to iOS - An underwhelming experience so far [A use case based assessment],"I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.

Usecase 1) -Â **Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone -**Â I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day. While at work, having loud notification alerts becomes irritating. So, on android(One plus) I used to keep my notification volume low so that it doesn't become jarring to my colleagues. However, I still kept my call ringtone volume high so that I don't miss the 1-2 important calls that I get everyday on an average. To state the requirement explicitly, I want the notifications to be loud enough to be audible to me only (when I am with the phone) but I want the call ringtone to be loud enough to be audible from few metres away.Â ***This does not seem to be possible on iOS.***Â I don't think this is something that is unique to me. Most folks get a lot of notifications on several apps but rarely get any calls. It seems absurd to group the volume levels of these two functionalities.

Here's a discussion about this on Apple support thread -Â [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254940088?sortBy=best&amp;page=1](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254940088?sortBy=best&amp;page=1)

Usecase 2) -Â **Standardized gestures to move back -**Â iOS implements gestures in an 'interesting' way. In most cases within an app, you can use gestures to go back to previous page/screen. However, when it comes to opening another app within an app(like opening webpage from an app), you would have to click on the button at the top left corner of the screen to go back to the previous app. This I feel is a downgrade from how it is handled in Android. On Android, you swipe right to back to previous screen/window irrespective of whether its within the same app or moving to another app.

Usecase 3) -Â **Selecting files/images -**Â Selecting multiple images/files is a very common activity on mobile phones. On my One Plus phone, I could simply long press any file to bring selection option wherein I can select multiple files. But on iphone, I have to go to the top of the screen to enable this option. This seems pretty unintuitive and requires extra effort on part of user to enable a functionality.

Usecase 4) -Â **Blocking spam message senders -**Â Most of us get probably dozens of spam/marketing messages on our mobile phones from Banks/Telecom providers etc. Blocking these senders should be effortless. On One Plus, I could use the same functionality that I had mentioned in last usecase i-e I could simple long press a message and a contextual menu used to pop up which had the option of adding the contact in to block list. On iOS, I have to open the message by clicking on it and then click on the sender icon, click on info and then click Block Caller to stop these spam messages. This seems like a lot of work.

Usecase 5) -Â **View images/documents on Files app -**Â Now, this isn't a design issue per se. The files app seems to be working perfectly fine for most folks. However, many people have reported that their Files app freezes especially if they are trying to open big files. For me the issue is with transferred pictures from my old phone. Whenever, I am trying to open the pictures on Files app, the app freezes without any warning. I don't think the files are corrupted as I can view the images fine on the Photos app.

Here's a discussion about this on Apple support page -Â [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255068777?sortBy=best](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255068777?sortBy=best)

It seems to be happening on ipads as well.

So, the general claim that Apple products just seem to work is untrue at least from what I have observed after using iOS for few days. Iphone 15 was my first apple product and its most likely is going to be my last as well. Its not that the iphone is very bad or unusable. It does the work for most part but then a mid range android also does that. I don't see why I should be paying a premium price for this experience.

2020-06-23,1592887555,Snapchat ruined the reputation of Android.,"I know I'm not the first person to think about this but the more I think into it the angrier I get. Snapchat singlehandedly created the stigma that ""Android cameras suck"" or ""Androids are slow."" Snapchat's refusal to create an app that actually uses the camera API, or at least optimize the app itself, has made for a horrible experience on Android since day 1. Even as Android cameras surpassed iPhones long ago, Snapchat never took the time to implement a proper capture function from the camera, and instead opted to take a screen capture of the camera view. Due to Snap's popularity, especially among teens to young adults, the image that Android is horrible spread like wildfire. The years of Snapchat being so popular, and being so unoptimized for Android has permanently tarnished the record of Android for a huge percentage of that age group. If Snapchat had optimized, even for just a handful of major Android phones, that entire view would've faded significantly years ago. But they didn't, and now the generation who's addicted to Snapchat will forever see every Android phone as a piece of junk for poor people.

Edit: So a lot of people are interpreting this wrong and I want to clarify. I'm speaking on experience with my age demographic. Sure you can say ""Snapchat is dead nobody uses it"" all you want but my age group *does* use it. Many rely on it. Having a poor preforming Snapchat app is a deal breaker for many people I've talked to when discussing Android vs iPhone. So maybe this seems like a stretch for some people to believe, but the influencer community, internet meme communities, casual teenage users, and the like have had poor experiences with Snapchat on Android and now associate Android with poor camera quality.",Android,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/he8630/snapchat_ruined_the_reputation_of_android/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2021-12-18,1639860094,Google Messages sends MMS video in much higher quality than Messages on iOS,"TL;DR: You can find the side-by-side comparison video [here](https://imgur.com/a/QQDkHSI).

&amp;#x200B;

I recently noticed that videos I sent from my phone (over MMS) were much less blurry than videos sent from iPhones to me. I decided to test this theory, and sent the same 42-second test clip (over MMS) from an iPhone SE on iOS 14.7.1 and from my OnePlus 6T on Android 11 with Google Messages 10.9.360 to my Google Voice number.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some statistics:**

Original video:

* File size: 23,484 KB
* Media info: H.264 AVC codec, unletterboxed 800x1920, 23.97fps, 4437 kb/s with stereo MPEG AAC audio at 48000 Hz with 32 bits/sample
* Note: I rotated the source video by 90 degrees (into portrait orientation) to test for letterboxing, where the video is encoded with black bars along the edges

Video sent from Messages on iOS

* File size: 974 KB (as reported by Google Voice). (iOS Messages does not report the file size of outgoing media)
* Media info: H.264 AVC codec, letterboxed 176x144, 10fps, 57 kb/s with stereo MPEG AAC audio at 48000 Hz with 32 bits/sample

Video sent from Google Messages

* File size: 850 KB (as reported by Google Messages), 3,092 KB (as reported by Google Voice)
* Media info: H.264 AVC codec, unletterboxed 224x540, 23.97fps, 468 kb/s with stereo MPEG AAC audio at 48000 Hz with 32 bits/sample

I also made a [side-by-side comparison video](https://imgur.com/a/QQDkHSI) (also linked above) that shows the quality difference.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis:**

It looks like Google Voice is doing some reencoding of these videos, as the files downloaded were much larger than I expected (my carrier has a 1MB attachment limit, and the GM video I downloaded from Google Voice was 3 MB in size). Google Messages on my device reports the size as 850 KB. Given that the encoder listed for both videos is ""Google"" and both are in MP4 format, I suspect Google Voice is doing some reencoding to make these videos more compatible.

It appears that the reason iOS's video quality is so low is because iOS video is sent in the [3GPP format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GP_and_3G2), which was first introduced in 2003 and designed to send video over 3G networks. Google Messages sends larger video files in the MP4 format, allowing for better quality.

Also, for whatever reason, iOS sends videos in 11:9 aspect ratio, no matter the aspect ratio of the source, which means portrait videos are letterboxed (i.e. the video is scaled down to fit the 11:9 aspect ratio, creating empty space at both sides). Thus, when playing these videos back, the video will never completely fill the screen. When held in portrait mode, the letterboxed video is shown at its maximum width on your device, but as it contains hardcoded empty space on the left and right sides, the video appears very small onscreen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

It's unclear why iOS Messages still sends videos in the 3GPP format. Perhaps Apple wants to ensure these videos are compatible with older 3G devices or perhaps iPhones have always sent 3GPP video and Apple hasn't considered switching formats.

However, it may be that Apple is choosing to keep MMS quality lower than it could be in order to highlight the differences between MMS and iMessage. SMS conversations on iOS have [suspiciously lower contrast](https://medium.com/@_sdc/how-apple-taught-its-users-to-hate-android-through-subtle-design-cues-518cd7eda80), and Apple often tries to hide the deficiencies of sent SMSes by hiding sent reaction SMSes and displaying sent videos in full quality (as opposed to showing the compressed version that is actually sent). I suspect Apple is trying to teach its users to expect a higher quality messaging experience than MMS can support, in order to make MMS (and, by extension, Android) feel more broken than it needs to be. This teaches iPhone users that *their* phone is the one sending high-quality videos and reactions, and that the default texting experience is high-quality. This expectation only leads to disappointment when low-quality videos/reactions are received over SMS, creating an unfair resentment of MMS and, by extension, Android. MMS quality is kept low in order to widen that expectation gap.",Android,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/rjg47l/google_messages_sends_mms_video_in_much_higher/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2025-02-04,1738689310,Why Im Returning My $1600+ Samsung S25 Ultra  And You Might Too,"Edit: Yes, I wrote this message myself and used ChatGPT to format it for better readability. The content remains the samejust easier to follow. If you would rather see my poorly written review DM me lol. 



Original post:
I was initially skeptical of the widespread criticism surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but after receiving my 1TB model, I quickly understood the frustration. I had planned to trade in my Galaxy S22 for $600, expecting a substantial upgrade. However, after testing the S25 Ultra, I found the differences to be minimalcertain aspects even felt like a downgrade.

Underwhelming Improvements for a Premium Price

With a starting price of $1,400, I expected significant enhancements, but the S25 Ultra left me unimpressed. The phone doesnt feel noticeably faster, and the cameras actually seem to perform worse than previous models. The macro photography, which I was particularly excited about, was a letdownmy old Note 5 captured better close-up shots. Additionally, Samsung removed Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, reducing its versatility.

Samsungs AI Promises Were Misleading

Samsung heavily marketed AI as the defining feature of the S25 Ultra, claiming during its launch event that all AI processing could be done locally on the device. This turned out to be misleading. Even after enabling the ""local AI"" setting to keep data on-device, I found that many features still required cloud access to function. This raises privacy concerns and contradicts Samsungs core marketing message.

AI and Image Generation Fell Flat

Beyond the misleading AI claims, the phones generative image features were disappointing. Samsung positioned AI as the main selling point of the S25 Ultra, yet the execution feels rushed and underdeveloped. Instead of true AI innovation, it seems like Samsung is simply riding the AI hype train without delivering a meaningful user experience.

Not Enough to Justify the Price Tag

At $1,400 and up, the S25 Ultra needed to bring substantial improvements, but it doesnt. This release feels more like an incremental iPhone-style updatesomething unexpected from Samsung, which was once known for pushing boundaries. Rather than innovating, they seem to be cutting corners while relying on AI buzzwords.

For the first time ever, Im returning a Samsung device. If you decided to keep your old phone instead of upgrading, let me know in the comments.

2013-05-22,1369232241,"Since nearly every site just ignored I/O after the Keynote was over, here are some little facts and speculations I find interesting.","If you're like me, you probably had a lot of anticipation for Google I/O. And even though there wasn't a new N7 or Android 4.3, there was a whole bunch of nice stuff in the sessions that could have warranted for a few articles from our loved bloggers. But they never came. So I thought I throw around some stuff, see what sticks. Lets jump right in.


**1. What's up with the next version of Android?**

I'm fairly certain that when the I/O sessions were planned, a place for the 4.3 announcement was in the keynote. Under other circumstances, Google would have never held that graphics talk the way they did. What went wrong and when the decision came to pull the 4.3 announcement and why, we don't know, but there are a few guesses that don't sound too far fetched, but more on that later.


 - What do we know about 4.3?

First, we pretty much know that it's gonna be 4.3 and still be called Jelly Bean. AP discussed this in their podcast, all the usual signs are there, server logs, leaked builds, benchmark stats (IIRC). The reasons for that could be pretty simple, A year of new versions of Jelly Bean makes the Android Ecosystem seem less fragmented (an area ""critics"" love to adress) and they can reserve the big number (5.0) and a new name for a new major release, which isn't coming or needed right now.


 - What do we know or can reasonably guess is coming with the new update?

The next step in project butter is here, we know that much. I don't understand enough in computing to really grasp this, but in that one session, Googlers announced that they will change the way 2D graphics are drawn. Th GPU apparantly hates when it ""changes states"" (I'm guessing that means doing different stuff than before) and therefore it is much more efficient and faster to regroup things to draw so that first all the white space gets drawn simultaniously, then all the text, then all the pictures etc. and not from top to bottom no matter what you draw like it works prior to 4.3. Don't nail me to the cross on that, I don't really understand this, so I could very well be wrong.

It will however make all existing apps much smoother, there shouldn't be a need to change code or recompile anything for this to take effect. So when we get 4.3, everything 2D will be smoother. Also, developers get awesome new tools to check if their app runs smoothly and if not, why not. Why I think this is project butter is because they announced it back at last years I/O as a project to make the UI consistently run at 60FPS, and they talked about exactly that throughout the talk this year. In the Q&amp;A, they specifically stated that project butter hasn't finished with 4.1 and most likely will never be finished. So this is it. And it's coming now, they said it will be there in API level 18, we're at 17 right now. So brace yourselves for smoothness.


 -  Another project like Butter exists

Something much more speculative but still very interesting: In the same Q&amp;A (I think it was the fireside chat with Morill and Duarte) they were asked if there are other projects like butter going on in Android. The answer was yes. This could mean anything, from design to low touch latency, but the most important thing for users is battery life, without a doubt. We all know it, and Google knows it too. Woodside and Schmidt said this when the last batch of Motorola phones were announced, Google released a new low-power location API and I think the Android team is working at their project roadrunner. We don't know if this is really a thing, we don't know if this would be included in 4.3, we dont know how its called. This is obviously the most nebulous point here and I won't eat my own dick if this doesn't surface in the next year, but I think Google is working on this, and I think they're doing this for quite awhile, it just feels right to get that out there now. *I want to believe*


 - bluetooth improvements and new features

It already has been announced that new bluetooth stuff is coming, finally BLE and more information like ID3Tag for Audio over bluetooth. I only use bluetooth for my keyboard so it doesn't really affect me, but from what I hear, the change in the bluetooth stack didn't go as smoothly as hoped in 4.2 so this should fix some of the existing issues as well. For you who use bluetooth in the car, it will be pretty great for music to see what's playing and we finally have native support for all these little bluetooth gadgets to consume less power. We know this for sure.


And finally my biggest hope for 4.3:

 - A comprehensive and reliable way for App-Data sync.

Another reason why it seems that 4.3 was pulled last minute rather than two months ago, the new play service that rolled out shortly before I/O had this in it, without doing much on Android right now.

But I hope to the gods it will be a reliable and widespread way to backup and sync everything between devices that isn't backup-ed and synced right now. Imagine you could choose what data just miraculously stays on your phone but is backup-ed, what also syncs to your tablet, what will be restore when you get replacement phone or a different one. I could finally tell my dad that he doesn't have to use helium and cumbersome processes and just doesn't need to worry anymore. Phone broken? Tell Google and get your new one, enter WiFi and Google Account and everything will be like yesterday, send your old phone back when you got the time.

I think for this to work properly, there need to be some changes in Android directly, and the fact that they launched the option/function in play services already means that this should come soon. And if it does like we hope, this will be the last major gap in Android closing for normal consumers. 


So the question now is:

 - When do we see the new version of Android?

My best guess is 10th of June. That's the rumored date for the white Nexus 4 launch. The leaks about this device are substantial, it looks very real and it would be perfect to launch with the new version of Android. We can assume both the N4 in white and 4.3 seem pretty ready, so I don't think it will take long to see both, and the rumored date for that is in two and a half weeks.





So the first big chunk is done, what could we gather from the sessions that wasn't covered by usual 
techblogs?

 **- high performance audio**

I had high hopes for that talk, maybe you did too. I like music, I love the garage band experience on the iPad, I really would have loved if they just came out and said we did it, you just need to do this and that with your app and itll be perfect. Sadly that wasnt the case.

This talk didnt mention anything new for API Level 18 like the graphics talk did and it didnt seem like they made enough progress since 4.1 for any real improvement to be implemented in 4.3. They remained very enthusiastic and told time and again that they are working on it and want to get all audio related latencies down to unnoticable. So I/O told us that there is hope, we need to hang in there but there wont be anything like on iOS anytime soon. Also it became quite clear that with audio apps, the fragmentation really is a big problem. Yes, Rubin and Schmidt called it differentiation, and most of the time thats true, we surpassed the point where fragmentation is a real issue most of the time, but here it is. I wont go into the details because again, I dont understand them, but it seems to me that if an audio app works great, it depends on hardware and software, means your app has to adapt to a lot of the different hardware (and maybe test for it) and even kernel specific stuff can ruin your day. Thats why this team works with OEMs to get the non-AOSP versions of Android in the right directions. Bottom line: Android high performance audio is still a mess but theyre trying hard. But its not nearly on the verge of become good enough. And if it does, it will take a long time if we ever get as much and as good of audioapps for android as iOS does.



Moving on to something we completely forgot about after the keynote:

 **- the redesigned webversion of the play store and the services**

Yes, we talked about Google Play Music All Access and the redesign of music and the upload of books, but I think  the redesign fell short.

I think the webversion of the play store is ugly and we still dont have wishlists. They kind of announced a redesign at the keynote, and Im very surprised that it isnt there yet, because they never said anything about when its gonna launch so I just assumed it was right away.  I just want to ask the question: When are we going to see this? 

Also, the Play movies section needs some serious work besides the availability and the very limited selection. Its astonishing to see that the company that owns youtube has not even figured out how to play their content in 720P in the browser, let alone support for 1080P or 4K. I hope to the gods that when the new movies web section launches, this will be fixed. Also, with upload for music and books, it would be awesome If we could upload movies and TV Shows to some extent (hopefully with playtime-syncing). This would make chromebooks a lot more appealing as a secondary device to me and very handy for my tablet use. This might be due when the new web play store hits.



And here we go with the last big bit of speculation, and it involves the big screen.

 **- Google TV and devices**

I think the Android: as seen on TV session was the most interesting thing to speculate about from I/O.

You may notice that the session didnt include the term Google TV, which is a good thing, this term needs to die, the brand (not the technology) has failed, its dead. Android on the other hand is strong and a lot of people do know it and associate something positive with it. But Android as seen on TV wont be just another name for a butchered version of android on TVs, I think it finally describes Google TV getting completely integrated into AOSP. It will detect  the TV and switch to a Google TV UI. Google achieves a few things with this. They will make it easier for people and corporations to get Android working on a TV and they will counter all these smart TVs from manufacturers that warp android into their own little weird Smart TV. If Sharp or LG or Samsung builds a smart TV with Android and most of the software  pieces are already there, the incentive to cram in their own stuff in isnt that pressing, it would be fully functioning without it and has all the advantages of normal AOSP that TV manufacturers already use.

Alongside with this comes a high end device this summer that we know for sure. They said it in the Q&amp;A. I would speculate that this is the Douglas-Adams-reference that passed through the FCC a week ago and is supposed to be a Nexus Q successor. And I think It will be. But it also will be a ~~Google TV~~ Android on the big screen device. I still think they will update the Nexus Q when this launches with 4.3 that now also is Google TV.

Its important that its a high end device because Google demoed Asphalt 7 on such a device and said that some other guy was upstairs and showed cloud gaming. So it will be powerful enough for Android games and reach into the market of OUYA, but it also may be that Google is preparing, what I already suggest in /r/chromeos, a cloud gaming service.
This would fit in nicely with Googles strategy to make cloud computing mainstream and would give chromebooks, Android in the livingroom and portable android devices an enormous boost. Everybody complains about Gaming in Googles garden, this would address everything with a bang and put them directly into competition with one of microsofts biggest footholds and cashcows, the XBox.

Also would it get Google into our living rooms which could finally pave the way for Android @ home.

I think this has been holding 4.3 back, its a big step both technically and from the relevance to the ecosystem, I think Google wants to get this right. Cloud gaming seems like its still too far away but the rest should be announced alongside 4.3, the white Nexus 4, the Nexus Q successor and if we are lucky, a new Nexus 7 at June 10th. Im giddy already.

So there it is, my crazy assumptions and thoughts expressed in a lot of text. I hope you enjoyed reading and tell me what you think.

This is for people considering making the jump from 'vanilla' Android, with a keener eye for design/layout, who prefers a consistent experience over features, and who are wary of Samsung's design ethos.

Spoiler: For me, the *added* features of OneUI are less valuable than the *missing* features, and don't make up for the design inconsistencies that will drive you crazy if you have any interest in visual design.

So like many, I keep reading that OneUI has matured. It certainly seems that way from reviews and feedback in the community. In the screenshots, those of us interested in design are still going to notice some pretty nast faux-pas, but the community will assure you that you can tweak and change almost everything to your taste. This prospect intrigued me enough to give it a shot.

I'm here to disagree. Whilst you can change a lot of things, I'd describe the UI as 'inconsistent, confused, and very rigidly Samsung'.

&amp;#x200B;

* The UI has obnoxiously large border-radius on most elements. You can reduce this a little with some Good Lock modules, but it's still way over the top. This isn't a deal-breaker on its own, but...

&amp;#x200B;

* It's like the icon designers don't work with the UI designers. Whilst the UI is made up of geometric rectangles and severe border-radius, the design language for the iconography just doesn't match. It feels incredibly inconsistent, with very fine lines and no border radius in the status bar icons, circular icons in the quick settings, and awful 'squircle' shapes scattered throughout the UI which are completely at odds with the otherwise geometric elements. You can't easily change any of these, as I'll describe below.

&amp;#x200B;

* The most offensive, and hardest to address are the hideous squircle icons.  In fact you can't *really*  change them much at all.  This is something that's trivial in other OEM skins, but not in OneUI. This is an absolute deal-breaker for me as they drive me crazy. I tried several approaches here to get these abominations off my device:
   * You can't use your own icon packs like every other launcher uses, and the Samsung Theme Store isn't even worth looking at: most icon sets on there are very low quality, and none of them will re-style third-party apps. They *only* alter the 10 or so Samsung system apps. The rest remain ugly squircles. If I'm stuck with squircles, I'd rather have consistent squircles.
   * If you use a custom launcher like Nova,youc an apply your own icon pack to the homescreen, but the squircles still exist through the rest of the UI like in share menus, and it starts to feel even mroe inconsistent. You also lose the nice app-closing animations if you use a third party launcher, and the whole experience starts to feel very unsophisticated.
   * Samsung have intentionally crippled Android's inbuilt icon shape masks that allow users to customise their icons on pretty much any other device. You can force some shapes via ADB, but circle is missing, and none of them will apply to Samsung app icons - only third party icons.
   * There is a third party tool called #hex\_ that lets you build or import a more granular theme from their community, using some hacky switcheroo method to trick the Galaxy Theme Store into applying a custom theme. This sounds like what I need, but currently it has been broken for weeks due to Samsung's May sercurity update. It seems Samsung are really trying their best to shut this stuff down.

&amp;#x200B;

* Having a mixture of Google's 'Product Sans' font, and Samsung's 'Not Quite Product Sans' font is going to drive you crazy if you have an eye for fonts and consistency. Often they'll appear in the same view, and it is uncomfortable to look at for a typography fan. Samsung tout that you can customise fonts, but actually, you can only choose from their very limited list. Again, there is a hacky switcheroo trick you can use to trick your phone into accepting a third party font, but the letter spacing is all wrong, the weights get messed up because it only accepts a single TTF, and as soon as you alter theme or font, it gets lost and you have to set it all up again. It doesn't feel like a good solution.

&amp;#x200B;

* It is not possible to change status bar icon styles as you can on Pixel, and the Samsung icons are very fiddly looking, with small, thin lines and no border-radius. They look completely out of place against the otherwise bold, rounded UI.

&amp;#x200B;

* Preinstalled bloat like Facebook, some of which you need ADB to remove, makes the device feel non-premium and quite sinister. My first impression is that I don't trust my device because of the notoriously untrustworthy partner apps they've sneaked in.

&amp;#x200B;

* Raise to wake works *sometimes*.

&amp;#x200B;

* Face unlock works *sometimes*.

&amp;#x200B;

* The gesture for Samsung Pay seems to be the same as the Home gesture. You never know which you're going to get by swiping up.

&amp;#x200B;

* Not having Android 10's power menu, with shortcuts to your Google Pay cards and smart home controls is inconvenient. These items are behind several clicks with OneUI which seems slower than just jumping into the corresponding apps.

&amp;#x200B;

* Thankfully, Samsung now lets you change default apps more, and even includes some of Google's apps by default. However some things are still hard-linked to Samsung's apps, rather than using intents. this amounts to lots of small inconveniences which add up to an overall inconvenient-feeling experience.
   * Example: The camera viewfinder's thumbnail opens the Samsung gallery app, and there is no way to change this to your preferred gallery, even if you set another gallery (ie. Google Photos) to default in the system. This is annoying, as if like me, you take 20 photos of your kids/pets and want to quickly review and discard most of them, you find yourself having to jump in and out of the various apps to ensure that any you delete are also deleted from Google Photos in the cloud. This would all be all just seamless if Samsung had used intents properly on the gallery.
   * Example 2: You can set another camera (Gcam) to launch on double-pressing the power button. But it won't work if the device is locked, which defeats the point of a quick camera launcher entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

* Samsung includes it's 'Smart View' in place of Chromecast throught the system (gallery, quick settings etc). This no longer works with Chromecast, so it's pretty much limited to Samsung's TVs. This one's just an annoyance really, but the UI seems full of these links for things that I can't use in place of useful standards.

This isn't to detract from the things that Samsung does let you tweak, and there are a lot. Most of which are done well. But it's just feels that whilst you can change 100 unimportant little things, the big glaring things are not customisable. Most noticeably, Samsung's poor UI decisions, which could easily be customised if OneUI was as flexible as even the Pixel, which is largely touted on this sub to be lacking in customisability.

Having now used both, I can see why this sub is so divided. If the thing you like about the Pixel is consistency and polish, you're still not going to like OneUI. If you prefer tonnes of fancy features but don't really get hung up on design / polish, OneUI is definitely for you.",Android,316,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/nbv0mw/pixel_users_things_youll_hate_about_oneui/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

In case you didn't know, we recently posted about our game Doodle Assault here which received a fair amount of attention here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jxdch/built_our_first_android_game_with_some_friends/

First we'd like to say we're really sorry about annoying you guys with the notification spam, and a new version was shipped yesterday morning without the nag. This was largely a misguided experiment at implementing way to increase user retention. We're just a group of students and meant no harm by it, we were just playing around with the different features of the android platform to try to grow our game. Free is a hard thing to support, and we just wanted to try everything within out power to keep the game going strong. 

We admit our mistake in not doing an extensive user test before the latest release. I've gotten some pretty brutal feedback from friends and (ex)fans, so the mistake hits close to home. We know trust is a hard thing to gain back, but we ask that those of you that are still interested in what we have to offer, that you be patient with us as we're still trying to figure out what works and what does not. We're currently focusing on making the gaming experience better using the feedback from the last reddit post, and racking our brains and artists for new content. We completely understand the 1-star ratings on the marketplace, and we wont ask you to change them. 

Lastly we'd like to thank you all for your time and feedback, even if it was negative. We take every comment to heart and we'll try our best to keep everyone happy with our game and coming back for more in the future.

-Four Hundred Games team

**TL;DR:** Sorry about the nag! New version shipped without it. Never again. Thanks for all the feedback (even the negative feedback).

2015-08-30,1440953333,I'd be down for another Samsung Nexus. CMV,"I know many of /r/Android frequenters have some very strong opinions about Samsung's software experience with Touchwiz. Having said that, it does look like the general consensus in the Android community is that Samsung's flagship hardware is overall very good. Correct me if I'm mistaken, but:

* The camera experience on flagship Samsung devices this year is stellar  (I know, I know, software plays a big roll in that as well).
* The upgrade to UFS 2.0 Storage is a pretty big improvement over its predecessor, bringing faster read/write times.
*  The premium materials and design overhaul of these phones has been well-received, especially compared to previous offerings.
* Samsung's AMOLED displays have consistently pushed the envelope in terms of color accuracy, overall brightness, contrast ratio, and viewing angle degradation. The display driver allows for the saturation and other color components to be adjusted.
*  The performance and efficiency of latest Exynos chipset used in the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge +, Note 5 is respectable.
* The fingerprint scanner works well for the most part. Dirty and wet fingers be damned.

There are a few areas where Samsung definitely has room for improvement. The speaker quality isn't great and I know there are many users who were turned off by the lack of a removable battery and sd card storage. I was kinda disappointed when I learned that water and dust resistance was an S5 and active exclusive.

It's been 4 years since the Galaxy Nexus. I think it'd be exciting to see what Samsung could do if they had another shot at partnering up with Google on another Nexus device.

What's your perspective?

EDIT:
---------
Thanks for the responses everyone. I'm glad to see I'm not alone :) I know it isn't likely to happen for a number of reasons, but I'm honestly surprised and the number of people who would be excited at the prospect. 

A few people have mentioned how they'd like to see Sony take a crack at a Nexus device. That would be really awesome as well, the Xperia line is really underrated.

I figured it would come up eventually, but I did want to touch on the sensitive subject of Sammy canning the removeable battery, microSD card support, and dust/water resistance. Is there a happy medium between having a great design with premium materials and keeping this functionality?

I'd be very interested in hearing your ideas

EDIT 2:
---------
I'm having a lot of fun reading all your comments guys. Thanks for participating :)

/u/sunjay140 mentioned that Sony's Xperia phones have stuck a great balance between premium design and functionality/practicality. He makes a great point. Dust proof, water resistant, has a microSD card slot and a very 
capable battery situation. The phones are sexy as hell too.

No big deal, still enough charge to last at least the rest of the morning when I wake up.

2013-01-04,1357330370,"I took the screen size race to its logical conclusion - I gave up my phone for a Nexus 7 HSPA+ that I carry around with me in my pocket as my only mobile device, here's my quick review of using it like that.","**Background**

Like most of the Android world, I've been steadily increasing my comfort zone on how big a screen I want. Back in the day, I was obsessed with getting my phone as small as possible, like Zoolander. Then I got my first smartphone in the Windows Mobile 6 days, and ever since then every device I get has a bigger screen than the last, and I end up being happy about it.

There are a couple sizes that are natural points for a mobile device's size. The two big ones that jump to mind are:

1. the biggest size that you can easily reach the whole screen with one hand, and
2.  the biggest size that you can comfortably fit in your pocket

Apple's been stuck on #1 forever now, but for me and my hand size, the Android world left that behind once all decent devices started shipping with 4.3"" screens. I was upset for about a day with my 4.5"" Sprint Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch before deciding I liked the bigger screen more than I liked reaching the whole screen with my thumb.

With mainstream phones approaching 5 inches, #1 is a distant memory, so it just made sense to jump directly to #2, which is why I bought a Nexus 7 HSPA+ soon after it was available.

**How the size has been working out**

Overall, I'd say that I'm pleased with the size of the Nexus 7 as my only mobile device, but it's definitely not perfect from a size point of view.

What I love about it is this: How often when you're sitting around on the sofa would you use your phone to surf the web when you could also go get your laptop?

With my 4.5"" last phone, the answer was never. In comparison, the Nexus 7 is a revelation. Though it's still not as good as I would have liked, I do find that I use it instead of my computer a lot of the time, and the problems in this area are mainly where it's held back by software, such as the way the web browser is still very slow and awkward compared to on a laptop, but the form factor itself is great.

On the downside, it's just slightly too large for my pockets. I wear slim but not skinny jeans, and it fits, but it just feels a bit bulky. If it had bezels the size of phone bezels, I think 7"" would have been the size for me, but instead it has extra-wide tablet-sized bezels.  

Also, before I got a smart case to control the screen, the screen was often being turned on somehow in my pocket, presumably by the tight fit pushing the power button, burning up the battery.

Satisfaction Level: B

**Phone service**

One downside of the Nexus 7 is that even though it has mobile data, it doesn't make voice calls.

However, like a lot of people these days, I spend very little time making phone calls compared to surfing the web and using apps. I switched to Google Voice years ago and my friends don't even know my real phone number. I'm pretty much a perfect candidate for this experiment.

Most phone calls that have to be made I just take care of when I'm at home using Google's free phone calling on Google Talk. It's a little like the pre-cell phone era when you didn't feel like you had to talk on the  phone on the go, which I've always found a bit intrusive and annoying, only with the benefit of being able to text and chat on the go still.

My communications with my friends are pretty much entirely over text messages (free using Google Voice!), email, and Google Talk. As a result, this has actually been working out pretty excellently for me.

For when I really need to make a phone call in a pinch, like calling a store or restaurant, I've got GrooveIP, which lets me make free phone calls over my data connection. The quality isn't ideal, but it's workable.

On the plus side, my data-only connection of 1.5GB a month on T-Mobile prepaid is super cheap! Buying the refills at a discount, I usually pay a little more than $20 after tax a month.

Better yet, this plan is a data-device plan on T-Mobile, which means that I can also pop out the sim and stick it in my computer and use it there and be completely cool and legal still. I tethered before with my phone, but was always careful to limit my usage to avoid being detected. Now I can tether as much as I want, which is a nice perk!

Satisfaction Level: A-

**How it's been working out as my sole mobile device**

The screen is a thing of beauty. Mobile devices have been in a crazy resolution race for a while now, but at least for me and my 20/20 vision, what's actually been limiting how much of a website I can see at a time hasn't been the resolution, it's been the size of the screen.

Even with a resolution so high I can't see the pixels, it doesn't help when the text is still too small to read. It is pure luxurious bliss to be able to comfortably read at arm's length, like you would with a book, instead of having to holding my phone like a foot or so from my face like most smartphone users do.

The second biggest benefit is that the battery life feels like it's just unlimited. Seriously, switching from the phone scale of battery life to the tablet scale is paradigm-shifting. Not once when on the go do I have to feel like I should use my device less and save its battery. I just use it as much as I want, and then it's always got plenty more.

Another nice benefit I didn't really anticipate is that a lot of apps have really nice tablet versions that just work much better than their phone versions. I love on Reddit News being able to load one article on the right, while continuing to browse headlines and view images on the left. If only some enterprising developer out there would add the ability to load more than one article at a time, like with tabs, I don't think I'd ever want to use the website on my computer anymore.

One final point that's really nice about the Nexus 7 is that it's super cheap compared to a phone. Not only is the plan cheap like noted above, but buying one with unlocked contract-free GSM is even cheaper than a Nexus 4, at $299. That's the same that a lot of people pay for higher-end phones that come with 24 month contracts!

However, the Nexus 7 isn't all roses as a mobile device. A pretty major downside is that it has no vibration. Google was no doubt looking to shave every penny on the 7, and Apple managed to sell millions of iPads without vibration, so clearly tablets don't necessarily need vibration.

As a mobile device in your pocket, though, the lack of vibration does become a bit of a problem, and I find myself missing alerts at times due to being in loud surroundings. The only solution I can see is getting a Bluetooth watch or something along those lines, but the ones out there seem to get pretty bad reviews, and I don't really want to wear a watch again anyway.

The other major downside is the lack of a back-facing camera on the Nexus 7. On the go snapshots are pretty much impossible now, as are apps that rely on a back-facing camera like check deposit apps, and the loss of the flash that can be used as a light means I'm back to carrying a light on my keychain.

Satisfaction Level: B

**Conclusion**

I've intentionally left out reviewing anything that isn't specific to the Nexus 7 as a phone replacement. There are plenty of reviews for the Nexus 7 already, and suffice to say it's very nice but not perfect.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the using the Nexus 7 as my only mobile device experiment, and will probably stick with it for a while, at least until phone screen sizes start catching up. A phone with a bezel like a RAZR M but with a screen size in the 6.5"" - 7"" range would be perfect.

The only phone out there that I still think about is the Note 2, which is probably a compromise that would make sense for more people, but I didn't buy because of its exorbitant pricetag (more than twice as much as my Nexus 7 HSPA+) and also since I'm really sick of dealing with Samsung and other non-Nexus issues like TouchWiz and worrying about burn-in on an AMOLED.

tl;dr

Pros:

* Big screen you can read comfortably at arm's length that you might actually want to just use instead of your computer sometimes
* Unlimited battery life compared to a phone
* Super cheap data plans, $20-$25 a month after tax for 1.5GB of data from T-Mobile
* Cheap device at $299 unlocked and off-contract
* Can use my data legally on my computer also with the T-Mobile plan
* Nice tablet apps instead of phone apps

Cons:

* Slightly too big to be comfortable in pocket due to bezels
* Phone calls only with GrooveIP, but in practice due to texts, emails, chats, it works fine for me
* No vibration makes notifications on the go problematic
* No camera and flash

I disabled the ones I could and froze the others in Titanium Backup. These were the first to go:

* Lenovo ID

* Market Feedback Agent

* User Experience

So far, so good. Who needs that stuff anyway? Imagine my surprise when Magisk asked me if I wanted to give *User Experience* superuser privileges. Why would *Lenovo User Experience* need superuser privileges? How did it even *run?* I just disabled it!?

I checked settings, and yes, it was running *despite being disabled*. I stopped it, and disabled everything I could in *Autostarts*:

* After Startup

* Connectivity changed

* User present

I restarted, and there it was again, still disabled, still running. I searched the entire file system for *com.lenovo.newue.service* from / down and deleted everything I could find (a folder in /data/data and something in the Dalvik cache, I think).

Nope. Disabled, deleted, and in all ways terminated with extreme prejudice, and still running. I installed NetGuard, blocked *Lenovo ID*, *Market Feedback Agent*, and *User Experience*, and checked the log. Something called ""HOPO6"" is trying to get out (to ff02::16 whatever that is), but is not always blocked. ""HOPO6"" has to be one of the 3 since it *was* being blocked, but why wasn't it blocked every time? I'm later going to search for anything containing the string ""HOPO6"", but that'll take ages.

Searching again, I've just found the folder /data/data/com.lenovo.newue.service which contains the folders *cache*, *code_cache*, *databases*, **reaperfiles**, and *shared_prefs*. The folder *reaperfiles* is empty, but there's also a *.LenovoReaper* folder in /storage/emulated/0/ which contains a 17 bytes long text file called *did* with the serial number (twice):

    HA0LKxxx HA0LKxxx

After a restart /data/data/com.lenovo.newue.service is back again, but not *.LenovoReaper* (yet). Hang on, there's also *LenovoReaper* with the same contents.

I don't like this. I can't kill the official ~~app~~ virus, but I'm going to try to set all the files attributes to 000. That *sort of* worked.

2017-04-22,1492860617,Why don't Google and Android engineers care about scrolling?,"I was challenged to install and use the Samsung Internet browser on Android. It was a revelation. 

I mean, I knew scrolling on Google Chrome on Android has always been a mediocre experience. What I didn't know was that it is possible to achieve jank-free and smooth scrolling on a browser on Android. Needless to say, I'm seriously considering abandoning Google Chrome on Android for Samsung's browser. 

The Samsung browser scrolls just as smooth as Safari on iOS. And it was nigh impossible to get it to stutter, jank, or skip a frame even on my older devices, like my Nexus 7 2013. I witnessed the magic of smooth scrolling through Samsung's browser. What's worse, now I can't unsee just the stuttery, jank-laden mess that Google Chrome is on Android.

But it's not just Google Chrome. Many of Google's own apps jank and stutter with reckless abandon. As if their developers just don't give a flying fuck. What bugs me, even more, is that I get a better scrolling experience from many non-Google apps on Android than I do on Google's. Shoutout to the Fenix developer.

It's embarrassing but I have to bring it up. How is it that Apple figured out how to do scrolling perfectly on iOS almost a decade ago, but this is still an issue for Google on Android today? Scrolling is consistently and reliably smoother on my iOS devices than any of my Android devices, with the exception of my Pixel.

To be fair, scrolling and animations are smoother on iOS, but faster on Android. And I know Apple creates the illusion of smoothness by using slower animations and less responsive scrolling algorithms. The animation speed of iOS is usually 1.5x to 2x slower than Android. However, if that eliminates jank and stuttering, I'm afraid to say I'm all for it. 

But here's the confusing part. I have used Android ROMs on my Nexus 7 that mostly eliminated the scrolling issues. One of the ROMs used a combination of aggressive resource caching, slower scrolling animation, and less responsive scrolling algorithms to eliminate the jank when scrolling. And somehow it magically works for all apps!

Scrolling is the most used interaction activity on mobile devices. How is it that Google engineers haven't optimized the heck out of it after all these years? I get a bitter taste in the mouth every time I have to open the Google Play Store app. Why is that app still so fucking janky in 2017? 

Little details, like jank-free, stutter-free, and smooth scrolling, is why many perceive iOS as the more polished mobile OS. Mind you, this is a problem Apple solved almost a decade ago. 

Has anyone figured out how to make scrolling on Android smooth without Root? For me slowing down the animation to 2x helps a bit. Other than that, you have to pray that the developer of the app cares about performance and attention to detail. Also, I'm I missing something that makes Android inherently bad at scrolling?

2023-03-16,1678989135,"Qualcomm has open sourced its aptX and aptX HD encoders, making them freely available to Android OEMs. Here's what that means.","I got so bogged down in details that I sat on this story for months, but in the interest of the community, I'd like to confirm that the encoders for Qualcomm's proprietary aptX and aptX HD Bluetooth codecs are now part of AOSP.

Here's what this means for Android =G

A few months back, [I spotted](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1583181340165300224) a patch submitted to AOSP by a Qcom engineer called ""add encoder for aptX and encoder for aptX HD source code."" aptX and aptX HD codecs are proprietary to Qualcomm, so OEMs would previously acquire them directly from them.

I don't know what, if any, certification programs OEMs had to complete, or how much in licensing fees they had to pay, to obtain permission from Qualcomm to ship aptX and aptX HD encoders in their Android products. [One article](https://habr.com/en/post/456182/) says that at least in 2014, there was a $6,000 one-time payment and ~$1 per-device fee for batches of up to 10k devices. That info came from Silicon Laboratories, a fabless semiconductor firm that designs many Bluetooth products.  

The Wikipedia article on aptX, before my edit, falsely claimed that the aptX &amp; aptX HD encoders were added to AOSP in Android 10 and could be freely used by OEMs. That was NOT true at the time. The claim was added in December 2019 but was a misreading of an *AndroidAuthority* article on BT codecs.

What is true is that since Android 8.0, the Bluetooth A2DP stack added support for loading AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and LDAC codecs IF they were present in the build. As noted in the [AOSP docs](https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/bluetooth/services#implementation), ""device manufacturers may need to obtain separate licenses and binary blobs for some proprietary audio codecs."" 

This is where I fell down a rabbit hole of licensing and patents. AAC isn't free? LDAC needs certification? Etc. I'm done with that rabbit hole. I even briefly tried using ChatGPT to help me draft some of this article, but the tone/voice just didn't feel right to me, lol.

Anyway, when it comes to aptX/HD, OEMs would obtain encoders compatible with AOSP right from Qualcomm.

For example, on Pixel phones prior to Android 13 QPR2, you could find precompiled aptX and aptX HD encoders as shared libraries in /system_ext/lib64. Starting in Android 13 QPR2, those shared libraries are no longer there, as they are compiled statically into the Bluetooth APEX.

I believe that going forward, any OEM that ships the Bluetooth APEX in their AOSP-based project will have the aptX and aptX HD encoders available in their end product by default. There is even a [new MTS test](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/test/mts/+/2298682) (Mainline Test Suite) for this.  

Of course, just because there is source code for something doesn't make it open source. That depends on the license. To clarify this, I reached out directly to Qualcomm a few months back, and got the following statement (for context, in early November 2022):

&gt;""We made the decision a few months back to include the encoders for classic aptX and aptX HD in the Android Open Source Project. The technology is known the world over as THE superior audio codec for wireless BT audio, and we have worked closely with both Google and individual OEMs over the years to include these codecs in Android-based products. We are excited to say that under license from Qualcomm, these encoders are indeed now available under AOSP pursuant to the CLAs in place. 

&gt;As aptX codecs continue to be the leader in delivering superior audio quality, and with our introduction of Snapdragon Sound in March 2021, Qualcomm is committed to ensuring we deliver premium audio experiences, the lowest possible latencies, and the best connectivity solutions available. As per our usual business processes, the licensing of aptX, Snapdragon Sound and the underlying technologies, will continue to remain unchanged apart from contributing the aptX and aptX HD encoders to AOSP.""

And just to be extra extra sure, I asked Qualcomm to explicitly name the license and what products are covered:  

&gt;""There are inbound and outbound licenses to the project of course.  Once officially approved by Google - which we expect in the coming days since these were just recently submitted -  the encoders will be offered under the outbound AOSP (Apache) license.

&gt;""The purpose of the contribution is to enable people to distribute the encoders as part of their finished products. The only Qualcomm products included in this release for Android are aptX and aptX HD ENCODERS. All other aptX products require a license direct from Qualcomm.""

So there you go, you no longer need to go through Qualcomm if you want to include an aptX and/or aptX HD encoder in your ANDROID product, so long as you utilize the code in AOSP licensed under Apache v2.0.

This is great news for hobbyist custom ROM developers as well, as previously they'd have to just rip the shared libraries from a precompiled build (with questionable legality). Now you can just compile them from AOSP sources.

And yes, they do [work as shared libraries](https://twitter.com/hmtheboy154/status/1584408081626443776) if you change the blueprint to compile them as such. 

Here's the source code in AOSP if you're interested: [Encoder for aptX](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Bluetooth/+/refs/heads/master/system/embdrv/encoder_for_aptx/) | [Encoder for aptX High Definition](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Bluetooth/+/refs/heads/master/system/embdrv/encoder_for_aptxhd/)  

Since I know most of you have devices that support aptX and aptX HD already, you're wondering why you should care. Well, for most users, this doesn't matter. It's a change that affects OEMs for the most part. Surprisingly there are some devices that don't have either aptX or aptX HD, though. My NVIDIA SHIELD TV, for example, only supports aptX but not aptX HD.",Android,176,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11t16lk/qualcomm_has_open_sourced_its_aptx_and_aptx_hd/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2015-09-15,1442303806,How I learned to develop Android apps in a little over a month,"A month and two weeks ago, I knew nothing about Java. I knew some C from an intro class I took Freshman year of college. Today I released my first Android app. These are the steps I took.
- - -
#Starting out

I started because I found myself with a good amount of free time, and wanted to do something constructive (3000+ hours of League of Legends was just too much). I looked up app development as I've always been interested, and was inspired by [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1s347g/how_i_learned_to_develop_android_apps_in_less/)
Does it really take a year? I decided to try and find out.

First step was learning Java. I went through and did every exercise from [this website](https://programmingbydoing.com/), although I did skip the GUI/Graphics stuff because Android Studio would hopefully take care of it. This took me about 3-4 days. At the end of it, I had a pretty solid understanding of what Java is and fundamentally how to use it. 
- - -
#Learning Android Studio

So with Java under my belt (EDIT: okay not really but enough to start), I downloaded Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) and went straight to the Training course offered directly from Google ([here](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html)). 

At first, Android Studio was a nightmare. I had **no idea** what was going on. I spent a day trying to get the basic ""Hello World"" program to run, despite the code already being done (Google puts it in there at the start of a new project). Once I was able to do that, I simply tried adding things to it... a random text box, some buttons. This part was somewhat familiar, as it was similar to using the drawing tools in Microsoft Word (dragging and dropping shapes). 

Once I had a inkling of how the user interface builder worked, I went further into Google's training program, learning how to start a new ""Activity"" (a new window in your app.. sorta) by pressing a button. 

I found a few more similar tutorials on the web, and followed them just to learn how Android Studio works. All in all this took me about a week and a half. 
- - -
#Starting my first app

Someone once told me the golden rule to learning programming is simply to pick a random project and do it. So that's what I did. As a first project, picking a utility app (like a calculator, stopwatch, etc.) is easiest.

My idea was theoretically simple: make an app that will tell you which of your friends is the best at texting. I decided to make a list of project ""implementation steps"" and cross them out as I finished them. You can see my list [here.](http://i.imgur.com/HATpGht.jpg)
- - -
#Programming my app

The next month, up to today, was spent building my app. The idea turned out to be much more complicated than I had thought, but I stuck to my plan. Most of my learning came from googling how to do something, finding a similar example, and trying to tweak it to fit my project. I became quite adept at googling.

I won't go into the details here, but the important thing is I now **know enough to build a complete app.**

- - -
Through this experience, I found a new passion for programming. Hopefully someone else reading this can too.

If you'd like to check out what I made, [my app is on the play store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beau.textrank) 


**TL;DR**
I went from nothing to making my first app in a little over a month, mostly by making a plan and sticking to it.

2023-03-25,1679761001,My experience moving from iOS to Android.,"Hey everyone,

I'm writing a post I wish me from a few months ago could read to save myself a lot of time and a lot of searching. I used to be an avid Apple user for a good few years up until their various anti right-to-repair moves and their OSes became stale, boring, and restrictive (although for the last one, they have been like that for a while now). So my adventure started and I tried out a Z Fold 4 (wasn't for me, I never used the inner screen yet had constant anxiety about killing it), a Pixel 7 Pro (was very close to staying but the battery life was terrible, it had major heat issues, and was disappointing outer casing wise), and ended up on the S23 Ultra. I moved from an iPhone 14 Pro Max and wanted to find the perfect Android (having found the perfect windows pc and linux laptop).

The good:

* S23U battery life is comparable if not identical to the 14 Pro Max for my use. That was one of my biggest concerns and after the Fold and Pixel, I'm happy to find something that actually lasts me a whole day very comfortably. No battery anxiety!
* Every Android phone I've tried felt smoother than Apple's offerings. It might be their implementation of the refresh rate and animation speed but Android feels faster and snappier. Scrolling is near instant, closing and opening apps just flies by and everything is very satisfying overall.
* Wow, the cameras. S23U camera (sensors) are better than iPhone 14 Pro Max for me. It's as simple as that. Pixel was also very solid but the disappointing front facing camera threw me off. ZFold4 was very meh. (There will be more about this).
* Freedom! It finally feels like I actually own the phone instead of renting it for an outrageous one-off price. I can use a web browser that isn't Safari in a trenchcoat, install a youtube app that skips sponsor sections and doesn't show me ads, and overall do anything. I can finally use all the power a mobile CPU is giving me. It doesn't feel like a smarter phone, it feels like a computer in my pocket.
* Customisation. I very strongly dislike the stock Samsung experience. Goodlock, custom launchers, keyboards etc gave me the tools needed to get it to a point where I want it to be. After setting it up, nothing comes close.
* There's a bunch of stuff I forgot like actually usable widgets etc. There's a bunch of QOL improvements that are very significant to me and its disappointing that supposedly the best option on the market doesn't have them (I'm looking at you Apple).
* Double SIM card slot! For someone who's not in their home country, being able to have a local and foreign SIM inside is a godsend. Not everyone has eSIMs.
* Reverse wireless charging. I'm sticking with airpods and it's nice to be able to charge them on the go without any cables if I forget to do so at home.
* Under display fingerprint sensor, we still wear masks sometimes here.

The bad:

* The camera (implementation). Samsung's processing is just plain terrible. It oversharpens and oversaturates everything and when you turn it off, photos look worse. Even turning on photo softening in Camera Assistant didn't fix most of it. I downloaded a GCam port and configured it a bit further and am getting close to DSLR-quality results. I am so incredibly impressed by what these cameras can do and kind of questioning why Samsung butchers them. Fortunately enough, this can be solved. That's why I love Android, if you have a problem, there are resources to solve it.
* Google really really needs to reevaluate their Google Play policies. Some apps are very undercooked and underpolished and shouldn't be let onto the google play store before being fixed. For example: apps not using the raw camera api and just taking screenshots of the viewfinder, apps not using UI elements from the latest OS versions (there are some apps still using some elements from Android I've seen on old HTC phones!!).
* It is kind of disappointing that I had to set up my phone for 10 hours to get it to this amazing to use point but I guess that's what Android is. I suppose it's personal preference though because with the Pixel I didn't run into this issue. Once again, I appreciate that I at least had the choice to do that.
* Oh my god Samsung, I don't want Samsung pass and all the other random shit you've installed on my phone. Thank you universal android debloater for existing.
* No Apple Watch and AirTags. It's what I signed up for and I'm looking into a replacement for the Apple Watch but with AirTags, nothing comes close.

Overall, I'm very impressed and unless Apple comes out with something groundbreaking, I'm sticking with Android. Just have to find a good smartwatch.",Android,365,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/121qpcu/my_experience_moving_from_ios_to_android/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

*** ORIGINAL RESPONSE TO PITCHFORK CITY BEGINS HERE ***
      
__________________________________________________________________________________________     
Hi reddit.   

My name is Cary Abramoff and I am the CTO and co-founder of MultTask123 LLC.

Regarding [yesterday's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/292cec/its_not_pandora_spotify_or_rdio_its_radiodile/) that made the r/Android front page.      

It truly saddens me to have to redress this injustice in a pubic forum but libelous comments and reviews are being posted both to reddit and my app's Google Play page respectively; accusing me of not being the creator of the app, running a phishing scam, having the intent to sell my mailing list and otherwise engaging in less than ethical business practices.

Additionally the intent of these [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/292cec/its_not_pandora_spotify_or_rdio_its_radiodile/cigwrix) was clearly to sow the seeds of fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the integrity of my startup in an attempt to scare users away from my app.    

Additionally any redditors who asked for proof or accused these redditors of merely engaging in a witch hunt were quickly downvoted or shouted down in all caps.     

These accusations are patently false and are all based on hateful speculation, rumor and innuendo by a small group of redditors; primarily from yesterday's post.     

While I and my partner are in the process of reaching out to both reddit &amp; Google Play through appropriate channels to see what can be done to redress this issue I cannot help but feel immediate action must be taken to protect the reputation of my startup MultiTask123 LLC, myself, my partner as well as my website and Android app.    

To put it in perspective a little over two weeks ago a [post of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/27s3vm/ive_personally_spent_over_12000_hours_creating_a/) to r/Music reached the front page of Reddit.   

Over 50,000 redditors signed up for my promotion giving them lifetime premium status when my site [FMGEM](http://www.fmgem.com) and my very first Android app,,[""Radiodile""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiodile.mobile) exits beta later this year.     

Additionally enthusiastic redditors offered to help and I created a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/RadiodileArmy) where I had hoped to organize them. I additionally edited the post to invite volunteers to subscribe. I made it crystal clear that it was on a strictly voluntary and unpaid basis for those interested.    

Additionally my headline claimed that I had spent over 12,000 hours of my own time building this startup and our website and Android app.     

While the response to the post was overwhelmingly positive with over 2000 points and an 82% approval rating as well as over 200 five star reviews in the Google Play store an extremely active group made it their personal mission to ""expose"" me as a shady, suspicious and otherwise unscrupulous character..    

The comments from that post remain there for all to see and a large majority of those who took the time to try either Radiodile or FMGEM had both encouragement, constructive criticism and praise for my accomplishment for which I am indeed proud      .     

However an inevitable number of redditors had the following problems:   

1. Did not believe I have clocked over 12,000 hours on my startup   

2. Did not like the fact I was both encouraging and soliciting unpaid volunteers to help with marketing, UI/UX, graphic design and video production to help promote my startup.    

3. Did not like the fact I am starting a for profit endeavor and was offering a free lifetime premium promotion that required an email or Google/Facebook account to sign up for.     

I have no problem whatsoever that people may not believe how much time I spent on this startup that dates back to 2010.   
I make no apologies for attempting to take people up on their offer to help my small startup nor for seeking redditor volunteers.   
Finally I make no apologies for creating a startup that I do hope to monetize when it is good enough to exit beta testing.   
    

However it does become both alarming and libelous when one's disdain of my product, service, marketing or personal work ethic translates into both libelous comments and reviews in the Google Play store. This is an attempt to sabotage my success by spreading lies about my intent as regard to my customer's data and the security thereof.     

These comments and reviews either outright state or insinuate that my company is running a scam &amp;\or phishing site to gather users email addresses and then sell them. There is no evidence whatsoever to support such an accusation and my only intent is to build a business for the **long haul.**        

Additionally these libelous comments suggest users passwords are not encrypted nor transmitted securely to my database in the Amazon cloud. Again this is a patently false accusation with no bearing in reality and was simply based on vitriolic speculation.    

Both my website and my app transmit all data via HTTPS to Amazon and further all user passwords are secured with secure salted password hashing that is state of the art.   

Once the libel began yesterday it had a lynch mob/witch hunt effect and I elected not to take a reactionary approach hoping that people would see it for what it was. A clear attempt to sabotage my app simply because they did not like the way I market. Further I did not wish to encourage troll behavior by dignifying it with a response. I assumed when redditors saw there was absolutely nothing to substantiate such libelous claims they would not be taken seriously.     

That may be in fact the case but nevertheless from what I can gauge there are now 10 to 20 redditors who have made it their sole mission to sabotage my company, post links containing my name, address, a link to my home via Google Maps, information about my partner and such.     

Further in the past 24 hours these same redditors have been leaving libelous reviews in the Google Play store warning users to beware of phishing scams and the like.     

**This has been a witch hunt pure and simple.**      

Prior to my post two weeks ago my website [FMGEM](http://www.fmgem.com) which started off with another name in 2011 has had a few thousand loyal users who found me through several post in the past few years that made it to the reddit front page from r/Music.     

 My partner and I have always treated our users with courtesy and respect if not outright friendship and there has not been one complaint EVER lodged against either FMGEM, Radiodile or MultiTask123 LLC since its inception. This is pure fabrication by a small but committed group of redditors and I do hope that the reddit moderators respond to my private message to them from last night stating the issue and seeking a just resolution.     

I have also been labeled an amateur and various other insults in yesterday's posts and both my skills and work ethic have been brought into question.    .    

 In fact my startup is wholly self-financed and I have been working on it 7 days a week full time for almost 5 years.    

As for my credentials. 
    
I have already been granted a [patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US8548992) for one of my software inventions and my Android app has a provisional patent pending status.    

Further I have been an entrepreneur and developer for 21 years. I hold the Microsoft Certified Solution Developer for .NET credential and have over a dozen years of professional software consulting experience on Wall Street having consulted for a host of banks.    

I have graduated from a major NY state university phi beta kappa and am a wholly self-taught computer programmer fluent in C#, Javascript/JQuery, Java, HTML/CSS and several database dialects as well as most aspects of the Amazon cloud.     

To insinuate that I have self-financed a startup to the tune of high six figures with my endgame to sell a mailing list is both libelous and irrational.     

I will be answering all sincere questions from interested parties.    

Thanks!

2020-02-24,1582560632,Which Reddit app do you use and why? (2020 edition),"Bringing this back because the last post I saw on this topic was in 2017, which I think could be considered a little outdated. 

I switched to Android around the start of the year and I've been loving it; the customization, the features, the fact that it's not made by Apple, etc. One problem though: I can't find a Reddit app that suits me. I'm sure you know of the various stability and user experience issues that come with the official Reddit app, so I prefer to use alternatives.
 On IOS, I used Apollo for its simple, intuitive, and user-friendly design. It felt primarily focused on casual browsing and posting, and that suited me. But Apollo isn't on Android, so I ended up using Sync instead, after reading approximately one article on it.

Sync is... fine, it works, but it doesn't quite work for me. I'm not saying its bad, it just doesn't suit how I use Reddit. So I'd like you to share what version of Reddit you prefer and why.

2014-02-17,1392608439,"(Yet another) new android user switching from iOS: thoughts, advice","Hey fellas, this subreddit was really helpful when making the decision to switch so I figured I'd try to give back and help those in a similar position to me.

A while ago I ""updated"" my iPhone 4 (rest in peace) to iOS 7. What a colossal mistake: it's so slow that it's unusable now, even when I turned off all the whiz-bang features. I wasn't too interested in clean restoring a phone that is essentially end-of-life so I'm now using a Nexus 5. I actually think I was in denial for a bit over iOS 7.

**I realise comparing a 2010 phone with a 2013 one is a bit disingenuous**, but it's more the software that I'm comparing. I'll make some general remarks about hardware along the way, but I'm aware that this is /r/android.

***

Some qualifiers:  
I'm coming from **iOS7** on an **iPhone 4** to **Android 4.4.2 Kitkat** on a **Nexus 5**.  
I wouldn't quite call myself a power user, but definitions vary. I can program and know my way around a unix terminal, if these are objective measures.  
I've been using Android for a few days, iOS for 3 years.  
I'm not going into jailbreaking or rooting or custom roms or whatever.

***

**Usability**  
I know the consensus is that iOS scores higher than Android here (well, perhaps not on this subreddit), but it's just not true as of 2014. Here's why.

* **Screen size**. Not really software but incredibly important. With an iPhone, you get a tall screen but it's thin. I found myself double tapping to zoom in and swiping around way too much when browsing websites. It's good one-handed but your finger covers up half of it anyway. It makes using office apps a pain too. At least with Android, being open, you have the option of getting a larger screen. I'd recommend it.
* **Customisation**. Sometimes seen as a bit of a non-event (ie dicking around with your phone: so what, you can change the colour?), but easily the greatest strength of Android. Widgets give me at-a-glance information without extra taps or swipes. **This isn't a feature only for the tech savvy!** If you don't like the way a default app works, you can switch it out. Custom launchers let me categorise my apps easily to find what I need quicker. iOS might deliver an 'experience', but only to people for whom it's 100% kosher. Otherwise, you're screwed (see Apple maps, Safari pre-iOS 7). I simply **spend less time with Android getting to the information I need**. This only compounds itself as your phone gets older - I was spending way too much time on my iPhone. My friend in a similar position bought a filofax over using his ""smart""phone.
* **Inter-app communication**. By selecting the ""share"" option you're presented with a list of apps that you can send something to. For instance, I like to save things. I use Pocket and notes a lot. If I come across something interesting on iOS, I'd have to make liberal use of copy and paste or hop on a computer because the ""open in"" feature is so basic that it doesn't even exist on some apps. On android, it's two taps away. Websites, text, images, whatever.
* **A filesystem**. iOS is basically all about the apps. If an app doesn't have the ""open in"" feature, sorry, you can't do that. Dropbox is not a suitable replacement for an actual filesystem. Jumping through multiple apps or resorting to the clipboard isn't either.
* **A downloads folder**. No explanation needed. Hopefully.
* **Alternate keyboards**. It's kind of hard to convey how much faster you will be at typing with a keyboard like Swype or SwiftKey. It's insane! I'm still amazed at how fast I can type.
* **Easy access to settings**. Swipe down from the top to get to the notifications shade and hit quick settings. The information is presented in a way that is much easier to digest than in iOS settings. Battery, wifi, mobile connection, brightness, etc. It's not simple toggles like the iOS7 control centre. (Edit: you can pull down from the top with two fingers to get to quick settings instantly, and long tap to toggle some settings on/off. Thanks to /u/pineapple821 and /u/ExplicitTaco)
* **A back button**. I didn't know what I was missing here. This thing is insanely useful - no need to go surfing around for whatever you were just looking at (sometimes. it's a bit inconsistent).
* **Management**. App management, data usage management, memory management, management management: it's all there. Especially data usage: iOS 7 is a step forward but it's not as powerful or as useful as Android's build-in solution. Give it info about your data cap and billing cycle and it does the rest.
* **App drawer**. I don't have to deal with pages upon pages of apps on my home screen anymore.

The general point is that whatever I could do in iOS, I can do faster and more effectively (fewer taps, better information) in Android. And I can do plenty in Android that I couldn't do in iOS. If you don't care about the iOS experience and care more about actually doing things, no contest.

***

**App selection**

There are a few apps that I couldn't get on android, but they were mostly games (but I couldn't find [Magnetic Shaving Derby](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakyl.msd&amp;hl=en) on the iOS app store! It's been removed: a great loss for iOS). Pretty much everything important has both an iOS and Android app, so no real difference here that I've found so far.

The Google play store is more open though, so I guess there really is an app for that on Android.

***

**Looks**

iOS looks nice but you're stuck with it. Android looks nice too, but you can make it look better. You can also make it ugly too. Some might say a double edged sword, but I say strictly better. I had to suffer through years of a leatherbound, hand-written notes app.

***

**Music**

For me, this is one area where iOS is better than Android - at least if you're not using spotify. Managing playlists on Android has been pretty horrible so far. But if you just browse by album and artist they are pretty much the same. Make sure your album artist tags are set properly.

You're not tied to iTunes anymore either, which is a blessing for me (foobar forever).

***

**Advice to iOS users just switching, circa 2014**

* Make sure to turn iMessage off! Settings -&gt; Messages.
* Back up all your contacts with something like My Contacts Backup or through iCloud.
* Just copy over your music library if you use iTunes. You could use Google Music Manager, but then you're stuck with it.
* Install Swype or SwiftKey (or both: try them out).
* Try out widgets like DashClock, Zooper, or Minimalistic Text.
* Try out a launcher like Nova. This is more of a looks thing (at least for me it was. I'm told some OEM launchers are pretty bad)
* Make sure to set up a PIN. Swipe to unlock is not secure at all.
* Investigate your options to replace Find my iPhone.

And remember,

* You're not as tied to the Apple ecosystem as you think.

With the release of the dialer and contacts app on the google play store, I'm not sure there's much left in Android that Google intends to make open source.

To me, Android's open source code base is what let all these other companies create awesome features that have eventually inspired, merged upstream, or duplicated in AOSP (and iOS for that matter..). I use almost exclusively open source code on all my computers, except for some binary blobs related to hardware driver support, and would like to maintain that on my smartphones.

What devs are contributing to AOSP outside of Google? What can I do to support them and make sure Android and it's ecosystem has even a hypothetical chance of being free software?

2017-09-26,1506404237,"[Discussion] As Google Moves to Further Compete with Apple, what features/changes would you like to see?","With the recent news of Google's acquisition of HTC's pixel division, I started to think of ways how Google can really take it to the next level and compete directly with Apple. With the fragmented nature of Android (different OEMs controlling their devices and no real continuity), is there anything that Google could do to make Pixels THE android device over alternatives like Samsung LG, Essential etc? 

For example, we know how Google loves to start a project, halfway develop it and then drop it for something else to further confuse its customers. One thing that would seriously compel me to stick with the Pixel line over other Android devices is the development of Allo. I don't know if I speak for anyone else here but the one iOS feature I'm truly jealous of is iMessage. It's a shame that Android doesn't have something like that. Imagine if Google decided to integrate SMS into the Allo app as a Pixel/Nexus exclusive feature. To me that is a game changer. 

Samsung pretty much has a lock on the ""Android name"" for the mainstream customers, but doing something like this would not only make the Pixel more attractive, but it could also force more OEMs to play nicer to the ecosystem (closer stock Android experience, faster update rollouts) to keep up with the Pixel line. The Assistant was suppose to be the ""game changer"" when it was originally announced but kind of lost steam once it was rolled out to all Android devices. Don't get me wrong, I think all Android devices, not matter the OEM, should have all features available. But If Google really wants to compete head to head with Apple and become THE Android phone, I think they need make Pixel exclusive features.

I know this is a long shot but IMO that'd be a great option. Just let us pick the stuff we want when we begin setting up the phone. I remember ASUS doing something like this for the Zenfone 6 ( Zen UI and almost Stock Android) but it doesn't even have to be two different ROMs, just apps/services we'd like to install.

I know Samsung would never do this, but looking at my S10+, there's many Samsung's services I've never even touched since I bought the phone (for example Dex, Samsung Internet, Bixby, VR, S Health, Samsung Pass etc.) I know by doing this Samsung can't keep us in their ecosystem and some of the apps are tightly baked into the OS itself, but uncoupling them and making them available as add-ons would be great. I guess this would tempt even more people to try Samsung phones who still think they have lots of bloat.

Same goes for other manufacturers as well. People who love the services can have them enabled and people who doesn't prefer them doesn't have to be forced to have them installed on their phones. Best of both worlds.

This just makes me miss the old Aroma Installer days where I used to pick the Gapps I needed, fonts and even additional add-ons like Viper4Android, Adaway, Kernel Manager etc.

2012-12-19,1355956265,Just another iOS to Android story...,"I know there are a lot of this type of posts on here so I'll try and just highlight the things that were different for me.

Sorry for the wall of text! There is a pseudo-TLDR half way through the post. :)
 
**What made me switch:** I haven't had a smartphone that wasn't an iPhone, starting with the iPhone 3G. I like the iPhone and consider them well-built and user-friendly. But I think iOS has gone extremely stale. There has been a serious lack of innovation and 'Aha!' features that the earlier versions of iPhone brought. Also, I abhor the iPhone 5 design. To me, it looks ugly. All glass front and back is where it's at! :)
 
This brings us to Android. With 4.2, I think Android has really ""arrived"" as a mature smartphone OS and with the Nexus 4, there is finally an amazing combination of hardware to go along with the software. I LOVE holding my N4 and the way it feels. Plus ""dat glass back""!
 
So, it was a no-brainer decision to go for the N4, really! That's not to say I wouldn't switch back to iPhone if/when it innovates again but it's going to be a fairly difficult decision to go back. I still have an iPad and a MBP both of which I love.
 
**Things I was expecting to surprise me but didn't:**
----------------------------------------------------------

**Google Now:** It's an amazing app/tool but it has a ton of untapped potential. Plus - Battery drain! :(
 
**Things that surprised me as expected:**
---------------------------------------------

**Launchers and Customization:** I installed Nova Prime on Day 1 (although I did not switch to it until a few days ago) and was instantly blown away by the level of home screen customization it offers. Finally having an uncluttered home screen and being able have useful widgets is like living in the future. Also, ability to specify default apps/actions is one of those features that once you've used it, you're never going to want to go back.

**Quality and Quantity of Apps in the Play Store:** Despite whatever the general notion might be, Play Store apps are top-notch and generally as robust as their iOS counterparts. For many apps, I think Android versions offer so much more than their restrictive iOS versions. Also, except for a good quality NYC transit app, I have not had an issue with finding the same or equivalent apps as the ones I used on my iPhone. Day 1 of ownership, I bought over $35 in apps and instantly had all of my iOS-esque ecosystem up and running in less than 20 mins!
 
**Unexpected Surprises (*and this is the highlight and TL;DR of this post*):**
----------------------------

**Tasker:** I was completely and utterly blown away with the notion that your phone is an environment and every element within that environment can be considered as a variable, assigned as a value and tinkered with! I mean, setting the incoming call number into a variable and using it any way I want? Fuck yeah!
 
I used to write a lot of code back in the days and even though I don't do it now, I like to experience the small thrills of writing code and hitting that compile button to see it execute flawlessly. I have also written code specifically for iOS and Android.
 
Tasker lets me experience that same thrill for even the most mundane tasks equivalent in iOS.
 
Case in point: I was emulating iOS's ""Do Not Disturb"" feature - which by the way never worked for me the way it was supposed to. I'd have 6-7 repeated missed calls before it'd decide that it's probably a good idea to unmute the phone, no matter what settings I tried. It was so much more satisfying to be able to write a Tasker profile and controlling each and every aspect of that profile that I spent about 10 minutes basking in the glory of my own accomplishment that was my first Tasker profile. Heh! Granted, iOS does all that with just the slide of a button, but where's the fun in that, right?!
 
**Integration with Google Services:** I love how everything is synced up and how easily I can integrate things like Google Voice and Gtalk into my daily life.
 
**Implementation of Play Store:** The ability to go to Play Store on a browser and ""send"" an app to your phone - this is such an awesome and no-brainer idea that I can't believe it hasn't already been done before. In contrast, buying experience on iOS now seems like such a pain! I also think it is good for Play Store's revenue as it definitely encourages more impulse buying.
 
**LED and LightFlow!** It is so useful to just glance at the phone and realize the number and type of notifications that you have without powering on or unlocking the screen.
 
**Things that aren't the best:**
---------------------------------

**Battery Life:** Oh how I miss being able to go all day without having to charge mid-day! And no, I don't want to turn off Google Now, Location Services, NFC and all other things that make phone really worth it.
 
**Apps that blatantly disregard design guidelines:** I cringe everytime I see an app that still uses pre-GB interface. It really is a shame there are so many Android users out there who have no idea of its current potential.
 
**Carrier and OEM Skins:** Thankfully with the N4, I didn't have to deal with this but I have seen Samsung/HTC/Moto phones with friends who look downright ugly and slow. There are good features in many of these but it does not justify muddying up what could otherwise be such a great experience for users. If we didn't have to wait so long for the awesome dev community to release stock ROMs for various phones, there would be so much more choice in hardware. Why can't the OEMs at least provide an option to get stock Android if one is so inclined? I'd even pay more to be able to get a Droid DNA or S3 if it was free of all Carrier and OEM stuff.
 
All in all, I'm super excited to be part of this community and to see what the future holds for Android. Things are looking up! :)

It sounds absurd saying this right after introducing with that, but I am not a fan of Apple - in contrary, I dislike the company and wish I could find good alternatives.

I won't lie, they did a good job cozying up the walled garden.

But I am a slave to being able to text from any of my devices instantly. The streamlined notification sharing is a massive plus for me, as well. Most of my friends use iPhone, so group iMessages and bubbles and whatnot are super common around me. I also use AirDrop a lot, or even text myself files on iMessage to share files between devices.

I have an iPhone SE, and would love to give S10e a try for my next phone. But only if there were some sensible alternatives to these convenience factors. If anyone could shine light on this, I'd really appreciate it.

2015-07-05,1436075899,Android device (phones) should be able to blend into your ecosystem of other devices.,"Hey /r/Android


I have been thinking about this for a while now. I feel that even though the Android ecosystem is pretty diverse the phone or a device that you carry with yourself should seamlessly blend into your life. What I mean by that is, say I start a timer on my Phone, that timer should be available to me at all times on every other device. We have been seeing an influx of many apps like Pushbullet and AirDroid which allow accessing some of your phone functions remotely.


While they are really good services, they don't offer a lot. What I want to see more is along these lines:


 1. I should be able to organize my music, playlists from the web on google play music and once I am done, it should be able to sync across all my android devices.
 2. My text messages should be available to me on Chrome or some other application across the web.
 3. My time based applications should be available and synced across all platforms.
 4. Tabs open on chrome are synced over cloud and I can open all those tabs on my Android device (not automatically). 


Basically have profiles for all devices and those profiles can bring in specific functionality with them and can be used on other devices.
In this day and age we shouldn't be restricted by a piece of hardware. Granted that piece of hardware does have a lot of specific functionality but other services should be available across all devices.


What do you guys think about it? I picture an ecosystem where say you're working on a project on the web and suddenly you have to leave. You pick up your phone and all that stuff on the web is available to you.


You want to go on a run? No problem, prepare on your computer how and which path you would like to take. What music do you plan on listening? Set an alarm and set an app. Pick up your phone and leave and all of those settings should migrate to your phone and you're ready to go.


Your phone should just be a piece of hardware, everything else should be done on the machine you prefer.",Android,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3c69or/android_device_phones_should_be_able_to_blend/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2014-06-27,1403882440,"Unboxing of the ADT-1, the developer Android TV unit that was given to some I/O attendees, and some notes on Android TV in general.","Hi everyone,

I was lucky enough to be able to attend Google I/O this year and I went to the session on Android TV.  Session attendees received an ADT-1, which is Google's reference hardware platform for the Android TV ecosystem.

Here are some pictures of the unboxing: http://imgur.com/a/niUAO#0

Unfortunately, I don't have an HDMI cable on me to power it up and see what the interface looks like.  I'll be doing that and maybe hosting an AMA when I get back home, probably early next week.

My notes on Android TV: after the keynote I was *not* excited for Android TV.  I thought it was going to be another failed attempt to bring Google products to the television.  After attending the developer session, though, I did a complete 180.  Google has aggressive minimum specifications for Android TV hardware, and a standardized spec for button layouts, remote buttons, and the remote app.  They're providing us (current app developers) with *very* nice out-of-the-box frameworks to make games and apps look gorgeous on Android TV with minimal lifting required (TuneIn Radio rebuilt their apps for Android TV in just a single week).  I think they're going to get a lot of things right with Android TV, and the ease of developer support is going to bring it into a lot of homes.

2016-01-04,1451939562,WARNING: Your Google Payments Account can be closed at any time with no explanation,"Latest Update: u/googlewalletofficial restored my account. I am gracious for his help and understanding. The fact their Reddit account manager has amazing customer service skills and the people who run the department can't even return an email is stunning. I still want to stop this from happening to any other users. Reach out to me if you have any ideas on what we can do. 

Update 1: I decided to create a new account and make it a Google Apps account in hopes that I would receive better treatment. No Luck. They suspended that account and requested I send the same documents, which I did and then they closed this account as well. I have no way to open an account without it being closed. 
I reported them to the BBB so we shall see how that goes, other people seem to get their issues resolved this way. I'll probably take them to small claims as well. 

Update 2: For those worried this a scam. I never sent my personal information over email. It's through Google's own website. When your account is closed you go to payments.google.com and it asks you for the documents. And I blacked out all the information they didn't need. 

Update 3: The Risk Management Team will not reply to my emails and there's no way to report that they won't email me back. So there's no oversight of their department. I have spent 4-5 hours in the last day on the phone with the Payment Account Specialists (who have no control over anything, excepting chatting with the Risk Management Team). Now I am calling google headquarters waiting more than hour for an operator. 

Update 4: I know there are people who work at Google and journalists who frequent this site. From the response in this thread I am not the only one to deal with the same problem. It needs to come to an end. If you by chance know who oversees the Risk Management Team I would love to know. If you're a tech journalist I think this a good story to bring awareness to Google Users and people who are heavily invested in the Google ecosystem. As a former journalist I may even do a story on it, but I don't have an audience. Please PM if interested. I may or may not get my issue resolved, but I want the Risk Management team to change. I want transparency and open communication about my account if they decide to close it, I deserve a thorough explanation. Right now they hide their responses in two ways. I violated the Terms of Service and they are not releasing information to protect my privacy. Those are conflicting reasons, but there's no way to call them out on it.  

I am through and through a Google loyalist. Most of my digital content is purchased through them. All my books, magazines, music (including subscription), and apps were purchased through them. As I am sure is the same with most you. 

They offer great services and its just easier to have all your digital content in one area. 

If you're like me, I strongly encourage you to consider changing your approach. 

Google closed my payments account and then asked me to submit documentation to reopen it. I submitted the information and they permanently closed my payments account. 

That means the thousands of dollars I spent in Google Play is gone. Sure I can download some epubs. I can download all my purchased music. But my playlists, stations, and all access music saved to my library are no longer usable. My magazine subscriptions, gone. App purchases are up to the developers (if any developers could help I would appreciate it). 

I never dreamed a company would act with such carelessness. But Google is to the point of indestructibility and it seems they know it. 

I highly suggest you diversify your purchases. Consider Spotify. Or Amazon kindle. Or another magazine subscription. I'm not saying to simply stop using everything Google, but consider using some other services because if you go broke with Google this may end up happening to you and all your online content is gone. 

Also, I'm looking for advice on what to do in this situation. Any advice or help you have to offer, I'm open ears, and would appreciate it. ",Android,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3zgih9/warning_your_google_payments_account_can_be/,irrelevant,Stance: neutral,,,,,,,,

I am trying to help her get into a habit of backing things up. I will leave out the technical details as I'd like this to be more of a discussion than just one person's tech support (will figure out our situaiton on my own based on your suggestions).

I am not experienced with Android myself. Do a lot of people prefer to just stay ""in the ecosystem"" and have everything sent to Google Photos right from the phone all the time?

Does anyone use an app they really like that provides an FTP/SFTP server from the phone to copy photos and files over a home LAN?

Does anyone actually like the somewhat outdated Mac app, which seems to be kind of buggy? It kinda scares me personally, as some users here have reported data loss with it...plus it doesn't seem to recognize anything being plugged in for me.

Do folks have any favourite apps, either on the phone side or the desktop side, for Windows 10? I have both kinds of desktops personally and don't care which I use to help her.

Google Developer Console (what developers see) is now showing those countries in the ""Manage Countries"" list.  EDIT: earlier these countries were off and could not be turned on - this suggests either Google Play is visible now in those countries, or is imminent.

I just noticed this today - I do not know if the countries all appeared together, or in a staggered way.

It does say in the pop-up help that paid apps will not be shown in those countries - only free apps, and free apps with in-app purchases will be shown (however, in-app purchases will not work for now).

**EDIT:**

The impact of this:  this should clean up the Android ecosystem of malware-tainted APKs (many Chinese ""app stores"" have app submitters who submit the official APK but with malware, or with advertising replaced to benefit the new author).

And it should open up the market to android developers - who have previously not had a central location to target Chinese users (the Chinese market consists of a multitude of ""app stores""  - none of which had a majority share of the market - and submitting apps for China was a chore in itself).

2022-10-28,1666922946,Switched from Note 20 Ultra to Pixel 7 Pro (10 years of Samsung) - My thoughts,"For the first time in around 10 years, I decided to switch to a different brand.  
My devices in the past: Iphone 4s -&gt; Galaxy Note 3 -&gt; Galaxy s6 edge -&gt; Galaxy s8+, Galaxy s10+ -&gt; Galaxy Note 20 Ultra -&gt; Pixel 7 Pro. 

I own a Galaxy Watch 4 classic, Buds pro, and Tab s8 ultra on top of that, so I was somewhat invested in the Galaxy ecosystem. In terms of phones, I just wanted to try something new.

I love Galaxy phones and their UI, features, and form factor. The main reason I stayed with Galaxy phones was because of the edges. I love the waterfall displays over anything, it makes phones look so much more modern. 

Anyway, to the point.

First thing is first: I feel like build quality is just so much better on the Note 20 Ultra. It feels so much nicer in my hands and its design is just a solid 10/10. No other phone beats its design in my opinion. I get no fingerprints on the back as opposed to the Pixel 7 Pro and also the Display doesn't have this weird ""hollow"" sound when I touch it. I am actually not sure why I get that. Overall, the build quality lacks in comparison to the Note 20 Ultra. This might also be a very subjective opinion, or perhaps I'm just biased, not sure. 

Overall Pros of the Pixel 7 Pro (**Hardware**)  
\- It's a bit more compact than the Note 20 Ultra, so easier to hold. The camera bump makes for a good resting point for my thumb  
\- Thanks to the camera bump, the phone doesn't wobble when laying flat on a table. I hated that with the Note 20 Ultra  


Overall Cons of the Pixel 7 Pro (**Hardware**)  
\- I personally think that the power button and volume buttons are too low. I constantly need to bend my thumb to reach the volume buttons, and sometimes I accidentally press the power button instead. Just a thing I need to get used to, though. 

That's about it. I think the design/form factor just comes down to personal preference.  


Now to the important part:

Overall Pros of the Pixel 7 Pro (**Software**)  
\- The UI just feels so much smoother and more refined than on the Note 20 Ultra. I don't think it's the age of the phone that matters, but just the overall refinement of the software.   
\- I prefer the quick settings on the Pixel. Looks nicer and feels smoother  
\- Google Assistant's integration is great.   
\- The AoD animations are superb. It animates nicely when entering AoD and when exiting it.   
\- I love the feature that when you change the home screen's grid size to 5x5, and only put 4 apps in the default app row, that the 5th app will be the most recently used app, or just an app that Google AI thinks you need right now. It works insanely well.  
\- There is a feature that enables you to let the phone know what song is being played in the background. It works really nicely.  
\- I had no problems whatsoever connecting my Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and/or buds to the phone  


Overall Cons of the Pixel 7 Pro (Software - or rather, things that I miss)  
\- I miss Bixby Routines. I think one needs to use a third-party app to create routines, but damn, Bixby Routines was in a league of its own  
\- The same thing goes for customization. Since I'm in Japan I had to use ""Nice lock"", but you can just customize everything over there and I don't feel to be having the same freedom with the Pixel.   
\- I somewhat also miss the Gallery app on the Galaxy. I like google photos, but it feels slow in comparison. Also, the Gallery app had more features, or at least that's how I feel right now. Might change over time though.   
\- Edge panels. Man, I used edge panels all the time. Either to make quick calculations or open up apps in split-screen/pop-up window mode. Such a great feature.  
\- The link to Windows (Your Phone) app works nicely, but two main features are missing: You can't open apps on your PC and more importantly, there is no cross-copy/paste function. THIS is a huge thing for me since I used that all the time on my Galaxy.

Those are just the things I've had in my head right now. I am still keeping the Note 20 Ultra for a while. 

Other things to note: My Note 20 Ultra was from Korea. So many features were disabled here in Japan. e.g. I wasn't able to use Bixby at all (not that I minded that one). But I also wasn't able to use a feature called ""keitai saifu"". In Japan, we have IC cards to get on and off trains, and one can have that on one's phone, but only if it was made in Japan. So this is my first Japanese phone as well.   
The only reason I imported previous phones was that they were a lot cheaper overseas. But I got the Pixel 7 Pro for around 512usd. The original price was 120 000yen (819usd), but I got 10% off AND 35 000yen cashback (240usd) for the google store. 

Let me know if you have any questions about the Pixel 7 Pro or any tips that I should utilize to make my experience better.",Android,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/yfas7u/switched_from_note_20_ultra_to_pixel_7_pro_10/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

I love Android for what it stands for, however I've kinda become irked by it after all this time. /slight rant

  


\* Why do reminders get bunched together and unreadable, let alone not individualy dismisabale?

  


\* Why is it that notifications are only expandable if a certain number or less are displayed?

  


\* Why does 'Android Open Accessory' STILL NOT WORK with auto head units, non-chinese DACs, and other accessories

  


\* Why are there STILL inconsistencies with colors, layouts, floating ui elements, hamburger menus, settings, and more across all apps let alone GOOGLE APPS

  


\* Why are great projects like Google Music and Inbox being 'killed' or 'replaced' by inferior products, that then don't receive updates because the user base is 'too small'? News flash: the user base is small because the app SUCKS

  


\* Why did it take an entire Android release (8 Oreo) and 2 api versions (26 and 27) to fix a charging bug?

  


\* Why in the world are we relying on crap carriers to provide a decent messeging experience? CARRIERS of all people?

  


\* Why is it that I have never had a truely stutter-free ui? Regardless of device, kernel, profile, governor, etc. Project Butter was YEARS ago (Jelly Bean)

  


/end rant

  


Note: I understand the majority of these issues stem from corporate interest, money, poorly documented APIs, and what I like to call 'Selective Standards'. Some affect many devices, some are Pixel specific. I'm not fond of the idea of returning to the iPhone ecosystem but the consistency is just... nice

Edit: Format, clarity.

2024-06-03,1717409537,Chipolo Points and Card for the Google Find My network,"Got my Chipolo Points and Card for the Google Find My network

Last June, I pre-ordered Chipolo Points and Card and I finally received them a few days ago. Here's my experience with these Google find my trackers, which I'll refer to as Google tags in this post, as they rely on Google's Find My Device network.

The initial configuration process utilized fast pairing, similar to how headphones from companies like Sony and Bowers Wilkins quickly set up on Android devices. During the configuration, you'll receive information about how this network operates and the required permissions.

Within the Google Find my device app, you're given several options: ""find nearby,"" which will play sounds and provide hints as you approach the device, similar to how an iPhone 14 or 15 operates with an AirTag. You can also play a sound or share the device with a friend or family member. In terms of device settings, you can change the device name and category (bag, bike, camera, headphones, keys, phone, tablet wallet, or other); however, I couldn't see an option to change the ringtone or volume of the Google tags like you can with Tile trackers.

Having a Google-listed device that supports this network will enable the new network options on your phone. However, my other Google Play devices don't have the same configurations. For instance, I can find options for locating offline devices in the Find My Device settings on my Pixel 7 (android 15 beta 2.1), but not on my Chromebook (chrome 126.0.6478.24 beta) or android-based e-reader (Android 11). The Find My Device app on my ereader shows the Google tags, but they're not present on my Chromebooks Find My Device app.

The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I dont understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them. If you have Nest devices in the house they do help locate your Google tags which is great as they say your keys were last seen at 9:10 near bedroom display, Im going to guess that with Google TVs acting as hubs in Google Home soon this will also help find your devices/Google tags.

There's a lot that can be done to improve the ecosystem. For example, Chromebooks could totally be added to Google's Find My Device network.

2016-01-02,1451748547,Is it me or are the app prices slowly and steadily rising?,"I realize that this is a touchy subject. And I definitely understand that people want to make money. 

But has anybody noticed that good apps now cost $5-6? 

Basically, if you did not buy an app couple of years ago when it was first released, you're paying 4-5 times the price for it now. As they get popular, so does the price steadily rise on them.

When apps cost 80-99c I used to buy a lot of them without thinking, even if I thought it wasn't that great, I did not bother with the refund. But now with each of them costing around $5, you can quickly rack up quite a sum.

What is the reason for this price hike? Is just a case of developers thinking they can charge that much so why not? Or is there some other external reason?

EDIT: A potentially bad thing about rising prices is that it really discourages the switch to Android. Buying one app for $5 is OK, but buying 20 is costly. Here's an example... I was recommending Android to a friend who has an iPhone. He looked at my phone and asked, what apps I had and how much they cost... when I started listing them, he changed his mind. People who are bought into an ecosystem are hard to move, and increasing app prices don't help at all.",Android,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3z5eis/is_it_me_or_are_the_app_prices_slowly_and/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2020-11-10,1605023367,For those looking across the pond at the new iPhone 12 Lineup,"I got my first android phone in 2011. It was a tiny little thing running froyo like a champ. I am currently using a Oneplus 6 that I bought when it came out in May 2018. I have been really happy with it and will use it until at least May if not longer.

I have been mostly unimpressed with recent android releases. The phones that caught my eye and that are in my price range (once they are eventually discounted) are the pixel 4a and 5 and the samsung galaxy FE. Looking across the tech pond, Apple has produced some great phones that really peaked my interest.

I am also planning to purchase an iPad so the pairing would between the two devices would be nice. On my laptop, I will continue to use windows because I am an engineer and MacOS is just not worth the compromises in program availability.

I've been thinking a lot about the switch and put together this short cost-benefit analysis for switching.

**Reasons to stay with Android:**

* *Technological reasons:*
   * Customization of the interface - nova launcher, double tap home screen to sleep/wake, programmable shutdown times
* *Hardware options:*
   * fingerprint sensors, foldables,  gaming phones
* *Sunk Cost -*
   * A decade of investment in google play store
   * Google opinion rewards (If you don't use this, you should - google has given me $300 for answering quick 1-minute surveys over the past 5 years or so)
   * Several USB-C chargers 
* *Google integration (I use gmail and drive frequently) -*
   * Ease of sharing files via email, google drive, dropbox, and onedrive

**Reasons to leave Android:**

* *Technological reasons:*
   * 5 years of guaranteed updates
   * Convenience of Airdrop and iMessage
   * Solid reliable camera for photos and videos
   * Apps that always work well because of the huge userbase using the same OS
* *Cultural Reasons*
   * 70% of friends and family use iDevices.
   * Blue bubble FOMO
   * interesting gimmicks like the new magsafe wireless charging (The cases and wallet are stupid).
   * Marketing. Apple is great at marketing and I feel myself drawn to the iPhone 12 more than any other phone.

I've thought about it a lot and I will probably buy the pixel 5 for my next phone. The size really appeals to me and wireless charging is somethings that I would like to use. I will miss the notification slider to quickly silence my phone and the headphone jack, but these are not huge compromises for being first in line for software and security updates. I decided to post this because I figure that someone might like to see my thought process. 

My wishes for the future of android:

* That all US-based smartphone users would all adopt a common messaging app so that I can share photos and videos with my friends and family without the photo degradation that I experience on SMS. AFAIK, there is no good way to share videos from an android phone that doesn't involve a link.
* Small phones make a comeback. I have average-sized hands and want to be able to reach all the corners of my phone. Pixel 5 and 4a are a nice start.",Android,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jrnawq/for_those_looking_across_the_pond_at_the_new/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

See [here](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6b4ae0ac-829e-4284-8b95-403ffe3a2ccb/good-comp-vert.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20210724%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210724T190455Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0f3e5205b32a60499d81e4030b33db5295571fe16b4145edf1deccd940f0603e&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22good-comp-vert.jpg%22). Having a high-quality camera is nice but I read / write on my phone way more than I take pictures. If you read a lot on your phone and want to have stylus input, the Duo is simply a brilliant device and I never stopped missing those features after returning it. 

My work means lots of calls and notes and whatnot (non-practicing attorney its kinda unique idk) so **having a truly-digital-always-on-you-OneNote-integrated-moleskine is a godsend evolution vs. any other recent phone improvements in the past 5+ years** ***for me*****.** You tell me you're building a moleskine like that and I'd gladly sacrifice some things (e.g. wireless charging) for a usable, holdable, brilliant digital moleskine device. MS delivered sleeeeeeek hardware that fits that bill.

# The Duo x2 Post-Pixel 4

I returned it originally, but the Duo has been on fire sale so I scooped one up at a rate where I didn't feel guilty spending on a phone upgrade that I didn't truly need. And goddamn am I glad to have it back.

**The hardware still feels absolutely incredible in your hand** and is truly a technological marvel IMO (the thinness, holdability, and relative lightness cannot be understated). Gorilla glass coating all around the outside along with them sexy hinges give it the first iPhone feeling all over again for me where you feel ""this is the future"".

**I personally haven't been bothered whatsoever by processor/RAM.** Simply put plenty smooth unless you're eyeballing side-by-side comparisons measuring by milliseconds (and again, willing to sacrifice 120hz, etc. performance luxuries for dual-screen real estate productivity).

**Camera isn't great** but its not quite useless trash. I picked up a Panasonic Lumix and often wear Snapchat Spectacles so I'm good there anyway if you want technically the best shot do something like that.

**Lack of NFC** doesn't really affect either given I have a Fitbit Sense. **Wireless charging is missed** \-- but again if I wanted to build a device prioritizing stylus input and screen estate AND holdability/form factor I'm definitely willing to forgo niceties like that for a non-wireless charging phone battery that gets me through all day (I simply charge each night now vs as needed on my desk). 

**The OS** overall certainly still has some hiccups but nothing debilitating and much better than before; ""issues"" primarily center on the system just geeking out about which screen you want to input on from time to time. **You're definitely early-adopting here still so if you have no tech patience then stay away.** 

**Battery life is also some of the most predictable I've ever had** \-- lasts all day for my workflow/SoT and depletes at an extremely steady rate. Pixel 4 extreme battery saver is missed but the extreme consistency of the Duo's battery depletion always has me feeling confident re: estimating charge levels prior to outings away from outlets (and I have power bricks in all my bags, etc).

**The 3:2 screens deserve way more praise.** The Pixel 4 has 120 hz yada yada but I don't miss that anywhere near as much as I missed a) more screen estate (obviously since I'm beating this cannot-be-understated point to death), b) extremely vibrant colors and darks that pop in dark and extremely bright daylight scenarios, and c) Surface-style stylus input that 1) does wrist recognition extremely welllll and 2) reacts to handwriting w/ AI straightening, etc. **MS knows screen tech for tablet/stylus hybrid devices and it really, really, reallllly shows** with a surprisingly practical phone with hardware that absolute delights in everyday scenarios.

# Gamepass Entertainment Shift Major Plus Too

**The cherry on top has been Gamepass games in a 3DS form.** See [here](https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1396844093133660173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396844093133660173%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2021%2F05%2F25%2Fxbox-game-pass-update-turns-the-surface-duo-into-a-portable-console%2F).

Absolutely incredible for short burst of gaming. Gamepass in general is a ridiculous value but I was surprised how having it portable with decent input helped me further delve into games I wouldn't normally (esp. since never  a question of hard drive space).

**I'm a big casual gamer** (i.e. frequently play short, single player games on easy) so this turns my productivity device into a whole other entertainment thing (video viewing also incredible because a) hinge kick stand action and b) huuuuuge screen real estate) Having access to Gamepass with 3DS style touch input that games are now being built around is lowkey exciting IMO.

# Not Made For Everyone

I feel like folks have mistaken expectations about the device. **You're def early adopting** re: software jank (I remember 0 apps for iPhone days...) and it's a bigass phone. You're sacrificing the currently very refined phone systems for a somewhat surprisingly usable, versatile, productivity-based ""phone"" system. Be aware there are real sacrifices (worse cell signal, bluetooth, camera, etc vs. my previous Pixel 4) BUT note things e.g. ""big bezel"" complaint -- bezels are hugely helpful for stylus input tech (if you've ever actually used it...). Idealized world is edge-to-edge like a piece of paper but what a stupid thing to prioritize IMO -- if bezels help with not only stylus input but battery life, screen quality, thinness and holdability, etc. then give me some bezels and other cool major functionality improvements.

**If you prioritize things like I do then this is a super dank phone that keeps you in a pretty pure Google ecosystem (Google Workspace, etc.) well supplemented by Microsoft (OneNote, Office, etc.).** If you're not looking for something to supplement your workflow (or entertainment flow) and want extreme battery life or camera quality or compactness or something then stay away -- it's an extreme phone. 

**Foldable devices are undoubtedly the future** for all consumers (e.g. Moto's Razr foldable for minimalists, Samsung Fold for consumption junkies, etc.). This is the dual screen for professionals and it's brilliant IMO.",Android,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ore3ee/the_surface_duo_is_wayyy_better_than_some_wankers/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2017-12-24,1514139683,Thoughts on Pixel 2 XL from an iPhone X user,"I've been an iPhone user since the 4S days and have owned every new iPhone since then. Currently using the 256GB iPhone X. I have flirted with Android phones briefly in between. Had the Note 4, Nexus 6P and S7 Edge for brief periods but went back to the iPhone. I was looking for a secondary phone to my iPhone X and I really wanted to avoid getting another iPhone, so thought why not try the other side of the grass? So got myself the panda Pixel 2 XL 128GB. Here are my brief, random thoughts on the phone as well as the software. Won't be taking about the camera as I've not tested it thoroughly.

**Hardware**

It's not as good as the iPhone X or the S8 Plus, plain and simple. However, it's not bad at all. I like the somewhat plastic feeling of the aluminium back. I love that Google doesn't take itself too seriously and is brave enough to try interesting things like the orange power button and the panda back. It's a big phone, the bezels are smaller than most 2016 phones, but bigger than most 2017 Android phones and positively massive compared to the iPhone X. It's not easy to carry this phone around in one hand. The front facing speakers are a nice touch, but not as good as the solution on the iPhone X.

The screen is, for lack of a better word, thoroughly mediocre. I don't see any blue tint issues and I have not experienced any burn in. What I do see is uneven backlight on dark colors and a persistent 'grainy' or 'dirty' or 'sandpaper' look throughout the screen. It's not as smooth as any LCD or the OLED on the iPhone. Switching between the 2 phones really highlights how far ahead the iPhone X's display is. Not even close.

**Notifications**

I'll copy-paste a comment I made on AndroidPolice.

Notifications are terrible on iOS purely from a design standpoint such as having an endless list that takes up too much space, but in just about every other way that you'd normally use a phone, they're somewhat superior to Android. Let me explain.

- On my Pixel 2 XL, I cannot set each app to NOT vibrate AND play a sound when my phone isn't on silent mode. For example, if I turn off vibration in Hangouts, it will not vibrate when the phone isn't silent, but will when the phone is on silent. If I do the same for Facebook Messenger, it won't vibrate even when the phone is on silent. There is no rhyme or reason here, and each app behaves in either of the 2 ways. The vibration motor on the Pixel 2 XL is noisy and cheap, and I don't like hearing it every time a notification comes in when the phone isn't even on vibration mode. Is it the app developers fault? Who gives a shit. Why isn't there a universal toggle in the sound menu under the phone settings to A) vibrate always and B) vibrate only when silent.

- Notification dots. A dot! On iOS it's a number, far more meaningful, easily tells me how many unread messages I have etc without having to count them on the notification drop-down menu.

-Notification sounds. This is somewhat peculiar. On iOS, most third party apps have their own distinct notification sound, something not from the default sound picker on iOS. Developers have chosen more relevant sounds. On Android? I am forced to choose between the ridiculously inappropriate selection of notification sounds from the system. I am forced to use the same one for outlook, gmail and Flamingo because the rest available are so clown-like. No, I'm going to go on the internet on a crusade to hunt down custom sounds.

-Delayed notifications. Android aggressively throttles notifications. I had to manually put my most used apps in the list of 'battery unoptimised' apps just so that they can notify me in realtime.

-I have sometimes seen notifications appear on the ambient display even when the phone is on DND and that app isn't set to ignore it.

Where Android excels, and I mentioned it before, is design. Notification cards are stacked, don't take a lot of space, and I like the icons that appear in the status bar. There was supposed to be some cool new notification channel feature on Oreo but my god, the developers on Android are the laziest bunch I have ever seen. Good luck seeing this feature ever getting widely adopted.

**General UI and performance**

I LOVE stock Android. It's beautiful, it's consistent, it's colorful and it's so...playful. Where iOS is your suited and booted guy, Android is your casual khaki wearing dude (sorry for the terrible comparison). The live wallpapers that come on the Pixel 2 are so, SO nice. I love how there are little things I can do here that I can't on iOS. I can see the WiFi link speed between my phone and my router (really helped diagnosing some networking issues), I can use an app to see realtime bandwidth use. I love how the music notification changes color according to album art. iOS is plain and boring in comparison.

Google Assistant &gt; Siri. I don't think much needs to be said here. Google is scarily good in this area. It notifies me when to leave for work! Voice dictation is almost 100% accurate.

Apps on Android are terrible. It's sad, because they've always been terrible and I thought things would improve. First party apps like Facebook, IMDB, Twitter, Snapchat etc are just better designed on iOS and they perform better as well. I've seen weird and inconsistent scrolling and random jank on almost all third party apps. It really ruins the experience of an otherwise wonderful stock experience.

I've yet to see a third-party Twitter client that even comes close to Tweetbot or Twitterrific. I've tried Flamingo and Talon, and they mediocre at best. I've yet to see a podcast app that comes close to Overcast. I've yet to see a more wonderful weather app than Carrot Weather. Third party state of affairs is unfortunately not as good as expected.

Some of the apps straight up don't work. Microsoft Remote Desktop has scaling issues, my Samsung TV remote app refuses to connect to my TV.

**Battery**

6 hours of SOT on WiFi and very little drain in standby. Much better than what I experienced on the S7 Edge and S8 (non plus). It's pretty similar to the iPhone X I believe.

**Conclusion**

It's hard to pick one over the other to be honest. If you want Android-specific things then this phone is the one to get. But for general usage, I feel the iPhone X offers better performance and an unbeatable ecosystem of apps.",Android,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7lwlov/thoughts_on_pixel_2_xl_from_an_iphone_x_user/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2018-05-04,1525393997,What can Android/Google realistically do to overcome Apples FaceTime/iChat lock-in effect?,"This question is in response to the many PMs I received after posting about how I, a long-time and still current android fanboy, reluctantly switched to an iPhone after the birth of my first kid so that I could more easily video chat and message my relatives and friends, nearly all of whom have iPhones.  
  
While those of us on this forum know how easy it is to use Duo or any number of other video chat (and photo sharing) apps, the reality is that so many others  and  particularly many older folks  just dont have the bandwidth or patience to deal with non-Apple apps. And this is a massive problem for Google. So realistically, what can Google do to overcome this and fight back against those few iOS features that lock people into the Apple ecosystem and keep them away from android?  
  
Edit: I dont know why so many are being critical and saying just make them get Duo or something. Yes, I get it, and I agree on principle. But the reality is that many people are stubborn or have zero interest in using other apps, and many older people really do get confused by multiple apps or tech they are not used to, even if its simple to you and me. And also, you get to the point where you really dont want to begin every video call by asking the other person to download Duo first. Just how it is.

2016-05-23,1464033512,Android and ChromeOS are not merging. ChromeOS IS Android Desktop,"Since I/O, I still see a lot of talk about a potential merger of ChromeOS and Android. I also see comments since I/O that Android with its multi-window is still poised to usurp laptops from ChromeOS with a specific desktop version of Android.

I actually don't think this is the case. I think what we will see is the two platforms, Android and ChromeOS drawn together in design and app ecosystem, without either the merger or takeover scenarios having to play out. 

Here is what we have;

ChromeOS is becoming more material. Expect this to develop further with material animations and transitions. Basically a material desktop that runs Android apps, with the benefit of a full featured browser. The thing is, both Android and ChromeOS are linux at the core, so even before ChromeOS started moving in this direction, they were already closely related.

ChromeOS is now essentially Android Desktop. It is the desktop version of Android that has be speculated on for a long time, with a couple of big benefits

* Already having a huge adoption rate, with millions of units in the market already, and sales just rising over macbooks recently. Apple just all of a sudden became second to ""Android Desktop"". There are so many units out there already that Google don't need to sell the idea of a Android laptop to anyone. They have already bought them and will keep doing so. 

* It is an implementation of Android on the desktop, that is likely to be far more polished and useful than anyone had expected it to be. We already knew you can be productive on a Chromebook in a lot of scenarios, but a lot of people have been fairly derisive about the idea of Android on the desktop. But say ChromeOS with Android apps and all of a sudden we can imagine it being a far more productive environment to be in. Those that had previously sneered at the idea of desktop Android being useful, valuable, or productive are actually about to see something they didn't expect.

There is no need for a merger, other than a unified material design that extends the visual style of Android N to ChromeOS. Throw Android apps on top and there is only the name left that is not essentially Android. 

Now... fingers crossed, eyes closed... pray to the atheist god... please, port native Linux steam and we'll have a Material design Linux distribution, that runs Android apps, has integrated notifications, that's based on Gentoo and has access to the catalogue of SteamOS and Linux games. I'll install it on my gaming rig and laptop and revel in Android everywhere.

2018-02-11,1518368840,I actually kinda miss MIUI(details in description),"My last two phones have been Xiaomi devices, mostly because they've had great specs and build for their prices.


I previously owned a [Mi4i](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_4i-7211.php) and have now moved to [Mi A1](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_a1-8776.php), which is an Android One device.


Before you tell me I'm here to fix Mi's MIUI PR campaign or whatever, no, nobody is paying me and I hope you see why I write this post.


######***Things that I will miss in my stock Android A1:***


**Inbuilt call recording**


All that it used to take me to set this up was a settings toggle, and voila, make sure you can play back conversations you had with people when you were mostly asleep. I've lived in the Android ecosystem long enough to be sure I can find an app for this, but for me, this is a core feature for my phone.


**Double-tap to unlock**


My A1 doesn't seem to have this feature out of the box and I would really like this because using the screen when it's lying on a table(happens every day!) means I need to either stick my finger behind it and use the fingerprint reader at the back or kind of grip it weirdly(without needing to pick it up) to be able to press the power button. Doable, but effort.


**Screen off toggle on my quickball**


I found the quickball useful mostly for my auto-rotate setting and my screen off toggle.


**Swipe down on home screen to bring down the notification bar**


It is pretty uncomfortable to reach the absolute top of the phone while using it single-handed. Swiping down was *really* easy.


**Copy OTP button from SMSs**


This was a real game-changer of a feature. For anyone who hasn't seen it, [here](http://en.miui.com/thread-150243-1-1.html). Small, functional, clever.


**Beta ROM!**


I loved being able to get official weekly builds of their operating system before the stable version actually rolled out.


######***Things I will not miss from MIUI***


**Its god-awful app drawer-less home screen**


This got so annoying that I literally made alphabetized folders on the home screen and put all my apps there.


*Special mentions to the forced rounded-square app icons. Dirt of the earth ruining beautiful icons.*


**The theme gallery**


I actually know a lot of people who loved theming their phones regularly, and to be fair their theme gallery and the ability to mix and match is fun, but when I realized they don't have any clean dark themes on there, I completely gave up on the themes bandwagon.


**Mi Fans**


Weird community.


**Terrible battery situation**


Big battery, but pretty small battery life, probably because of bad software.


My point here is not really to fuel the MIUI vs stock debate, but to point out that as somebody who used MIUI for a while(3 years, actually), some features do actually stand out and are missed when you move away from their ecosystem. I think it is important to say that they actually try to shove much less bloatware down my throat than maybe Motorola with all those godforsaken Google apps. I'll just use the browser, thanks.


Optimally, I would have loved to buy a Mi Mix 2(or a OnePlus 5T?), but that was way out of my budget. I'm still wondering what I'm doing with my Android One phone.

Indeed, you can take a look at the difference between /r/Apple/new and /r/Android/new to see what would happen if we re-opened the flood-gates for all users to post their questions.  

All content submitted to this subreddit should be for the benefit of the community. This is why there are limits on developer self-promotion (..on top of the fact that we must abide by reddit site-wide rules) and why questions that are merely thinly-veiled rants are also removed.

To better accommodate the wide variety of posts we get around here, we're going to be making a few changes to the weekly thread schedule.  

* **Sunday APPRequest is no more.** After listening to some feedback and seeing the activity levels dip, we're going to be re-merging the Saturday and Sunday thread back to the original Saturday APPReciation weekly thread.  

* Since this opens up a weekly thread slot for Sunday, we will be testing out a new thread: **Sunday Rant/Rage Thread.** People love to complain about their device, a company, their carrier, etc. so this might be a good time to let people vent and possibly get some feedback that might help them solve their problem. If this gets out of hand, though, we will scrap this thread. *Please be civil, we can't mention this enough!*  

* Wednesday will now be taken up by a ""What should I buy"" Wednesday weekly thread. For a while now, /r/Apple has had this exact weekly thread. Given the much wider variety of Android devices out there and the abundance of posts we see in our moderator queue, it's clear that there's high demand for such help so we'll try this one out for awhile.

* **Tinker Tuesday and Someway Thursday are no more.** What are we replacing them with? That brings us to...

**/r/Android Content Creation Team**  

We sort of threw this out there without making a formal announcement, but if you were paying attention two weeks ago we posted a request for dedicated writers. Last week we posted a request for AMA coordinators (**THAT WAS NOT AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE GUYS SO PLEASE IF YOU STILL WANT TO APPLY [CLICK HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/30zlqc/meta_were_looking_for_volunteer_ama_coordinators/)**). Tomorrow, I will be posting a recruitment thread for people to apply to join our podcast team.  

Wait, a podcast??? Yes, a podcast!  

We're hoping to expand /r/Android beyond just being a glorified RSS feed with comments into a major content creation space. Our **content creation team** will be helping us do that.  

Let me explain each team in more detail.  

* Writing team.  

    * We have chosen three writers (yes, three, there were so many good applicants that we decided to choose one more than intended!). **Please welcome /u/MrIceCap, /u/deu5ex, and /u/TachyonGun** to /r/Android! They've shown excellent writing in their applications and we're excited to have them on.  

    * What will they be doing? Every week, they will be posting **Newsday Tuesday**, a weekly thread that re-caps the major news, announcements, app updates, device releases, etc. for anyone who may have missed out or just wants to keep up with a single thread for important news. In addition, the team may go out and interview developers or other persons related to the Android ecosystem. We are also giving them the freedom to produce other long-form content such as app reviews, editorials/opinion pieces, etc. We hope you enjoy the content that they put out!  

* AMA Coordinator team.  

    * For a while now, we've been itching to have more people host AMAs here. We've had OnePlus join us several times, we've had several developers such as the Xposed developer, and a few other AMAs. But rarely have we had big-names in the industry come here. We don't believe it's because this place isn't highly visible; our [traffic stats show otherwise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/about/traffic). Rather, we believe it's because we just haven't had many people dedicated to approaching others to do an AMA. I myself was able to get rovo89 to do an AMA within a day after just shooting him a PM over XDA. That's why we're putting together a group of people who will contact, schedule, and assist in hosting AMAs on /r/android.  

* Podcast team.  

    * This is our biggest project yet! We want to start a (bi?)-weekly podcast covering many different topics, bringing on many different guests for their opinions, or even for an interview! More information to come tomorrow. For an example of what we're hoping to discuss, our first planned podcast would cover the history of Android, of which [Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica has written an excellent article for.](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/building-android-a-40000-word-history-of-googles-mobile-os/) We reached out to Ron and he's expressed some interest in joining us on the show, but we'll have to first plan many things out before we begin. Most importantly, we're hoping that YOU can express your interest if you find this idea great! The podcast idea is something we want to do for fun, but also for the benefit of the entire community, so if you guys don't enjoy it we won't either!

2012-04-04,1333504269,"Here is my review of Instagram, the Android version. Anyone else feel this way?","So here is my Instagram review. It's long. Grab a beer.

Months ago, the app Instagram became a staple on my Facebook news feed. Everyone I knew with an iPhone was posting these trendy, poorly developed, vignette pictures. Being an Android only home, I could only assume that this was a lot of fun for iPhone users. They seemed to use this program 90% of the time they were taking pictures.

I looked around the Android marketplace and found a few knock offs. There was Lightbox, and Pixlr-o-matic, Camera360, and RetroCamera.  I tried a couple of them, notably the Vingette demo (which worked awesome) and decided that, though they took very unique pictures, it just wasn't something that I was that amazed by. I mean, it's just a bunch of pre-made photo filters (with exception of Vignette Pro, which is quite customizable).

Fast forward to today, the Android blogs have been all a flutter about Instagram coming to the Android platform after what seemed like an eternity. I can't say I was excited, as I basically knew what to expect. But, when it came out today, I decided to give it a shot. And honestly, it's worse that I expected. And not because of the trendy pictures it takes.

1) It crops my goddamn photo down to a square picture. The hell is that about!? We have these awesome widescreen devices that take wide angle pictures, and this app refuses to allow anything other than square? 

B) The filters that it uses aren't revolutionary. They are simply pre-made filters. There are a couple dozen. But, that's it. Almost every app that I mentioned above has this exact same functionality. Most of them allow you to tweak and customize the filter to some degree or another.

Fourth) The app almost forces you to upload the photos to their Instagram server site. I say almost because if you stop on the VERY LAST STEP before you upload, you will have finally saved a local copy of the picture that you can upload as you wish. The app really wants you to use the Instagram site to host these photos. Or share to Facebook/Twitter/Tumblr through the app, which will just link those social media sites to the Instagram website, and not actually upload TO those sites. Which brings me to my final gripe.

Fuck You) Instagram. Why do I have to create an account with your website in order to use your shitty filters? Why do you force my hand to upload to your site and share within your own little ecosystem of Instagrammers? Do we really need another social media site based on photo sharing? These pictures all look the fucking same! I really think it is you, Instagram, with the ego problem. Not all these tweens with their first camera phone taking pictures of their cats and bongs.

In conclusion! I get the feeling that part of the reason Instagram operates the way they do is because of the iPhone/Apple regulations on iTunes. I feel like they have had such success in the iPhone/iPod market that they didn't bother to take a look around the Android market before finalizing the Android version. I could be wrong, but that's how I feel.

I'm glad the app is free. I'd rather give my money to a developer who actually innovates, instead of riding the gravy train all over the mobile market.

***EDIT:*** *And, to quote user **1waffle1**, ""this seems like an exclusive 'Apple social network and photo sharing app', and because of its limited functionality and the fact that there are probably 6 or 7 other Android apps right now that do the same thing, doesn't make sense to Android users.""*",Android,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/rs6cd/here_is_my_review_of_instagram_the_android/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2018-09-14,1536947225,Cloud and app lock-in is making it harder to recommend Android devices based on their merits,"Backstory: I'm an Android user since 2009 who's never owned an Apple product. Yesterday a friend asked me what new phone to get. They didn't care for iMessage or Snapchat (2 killer apps that automatically put people in the iOS boat if that's important to them) but they and their sibling share iPhotos albums with each other all the time. Given the latter and the difficulty in moving all their shares to another provider, I suggested they get an XS Max. Hardware upgrade, drop-in fit with existing workflow, 0 effort and disruption required. 

FWIW I did tell them my 2nd choice was a Pixel 3 XL (despite my serious disagreement with Google's tack with the device, I think this is the best phone for nontechnical Android users who're already invested in the cloud storage *concept*) and my 3rd was a Note9 (the do-it-all, regularly patched beast for people who already have their own workflow and would prefer their device adapt to it than vice versa.)

It really saddened me that here I had a person who wasn't the typical Snapchat (whose Android woes are well documented) or iMessage addict, and yet I still couldn't in good conscience recommend an Android device to them because of how disruptive it would be to their *existing life and relationship(s.)* Heck, I'm pretty sure Android has lost the entire US youth market - except for technically minded or counterculture kids - at this point due to the iMessage + FaceTime + Snapchat triumvirate. 

Does anyone else have this difficulty? What solutions do you propose? Are people lost forever to ecosystems once they buy into corresponding clouds? What are the ethics of recommending ""evangelical"" solutions that ""liberate"" them from lock-in but negatively impact their lives otherwise?",Android,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9fu54f/cloud_and_app_lockin_is_making_it_harder_to/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_ios,,,,,,,,

Apple has recognized the power that iMessage has to attract and keep users within its ecosystem.

a. As early as 2013, Apple decided not to develop a version of iMessage for the Android OS. (Cue Dep. 92:22-93:1.)

b. Mr. Cue testified that Apple could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS such that there would have been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly. (Cue Dep. 92:5-9; 92:11-16.)

c. However, Craig Federighi, Apples Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and the executive in charge of iOS, feared that iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove \[an\] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones. (PX407, at 122.)

d. Phil Schiller, an Apple executive in charge of the App Store, agreed that Apple should not offer iMessage on Android devices. (Cue Dep. 92:18-93:1.)

e. In 2016, when a former Apple employee commented that the #1 most difficult \[reason\] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage . . . iMessage amounts to serious lock-in to the Apple ecosystem, Mr. Schiller commented that moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why.

2024-12-02,1733153505,Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem app compatibility on non-Samsung PCs,"Just a small follow-up to my [post ](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1h1zm88/my_experience_with_the_samsung_phone_and_laptop/)from last week about the Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem, I tested all of the Samsung PC apps on a non-Samsung PC, and put together a list for those that are wondering which apps are exclusive to Samsung PCs, and which apps are available on non-Samsung PCs. I was surprised to see that a decent amount of apps worked, which makes me wonder why they aren't all exclusive (or widely available).

There are scripts floating around online that spoof Windows registry keys to get some apps working on non-Samsung PCs. I was able to get Samsung Notes and Live Wallpaper working with this [script](https://github.com/kellwinr/galaxybook_mask). I was also able to get Samsung Studio (and Samsung Studio for Gallery), and Galaxy Book Experience working with this [script](https://github.com/rushiranpise/GalaxyBookEnabler/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Your mileage may vary, and use these scripts at your own risk.

2016-05-19,1463648048,After watching google I/O I got the distinct feeling that google is heading in a direction that apple can't or will struggle to follow.,"I don't want to start an Apple vs Android thing but, while watching the keynote I got the distinct feeling that Google is building on its strengths for Android and they happen to be in places that Apple will find it hard to compete in.

**Instant Apps** Aims at the heart of the modern app ecosystem and is a win for consumers but something Apple won't even attempt.

**Google assistant** leverages Google's significant lead in AI compared to most of its competitors.

**Google Home** Also plays on the Google AI and Google Cast ecosystem

**Android VR** This is one place Apple can easily compete if they choose to do so. But if Google plays it right they can have the mindshare before Apple even gets in the game.

**Allo** Bots and AI again(iMessage won't be able to compete because of E2E encryption). And with it being based on phone numbers they can turn it into an iMessage competitor...eventually(but this is something that only really concerns the US)

**Wear 2.0** Apple does compete here and in many ways they are already winning. If google can get more famous brands in and the self contained smart watch thing(no phone needed) work as they are advertised they may be able to take the fight to apple.


Of course Android Update problem is going to hold VR back and Allo will depend on adoption but everything else will jump ahead quickly.
All in all I think this is a good play by Google to focus on their strengths.

Anyway that's my 2c, what do you think?

p.s. before I get accused of it i'm not counting Apple out, I'm just saying Google is smart to focus on their strengths and double down on it. I'm sure Apple will do the same with their hardware and ecosystem integration.",Android,1021,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4k1krz/after_watching_google_io_i_got_the_distinct/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2016-05-19,1463687778,I honestly find this whole Allo/Duo thing the most confusing move Google has ever made.,"I seriously just don't get it. It is the complete opposite of what everyone has been asking for. How did this even get approved at a corporate level?

Users have been begging for a unified messaging solution. The present situation was pretty reasonable: Messenger for a lightweight SMS app, and Hangouts for cross-platform messaging and video calling with optional SMS integration if you don't want two apps.

Hangouts is everywhere throughout the Google ecosystem. You can access it from either Gmail interface, through G+ on the web, through the standalone Hangouts site, through the Chrome extension, and through your phone or tablet. It may not be the best-developed app in the world (though I personally don't have too many issues with it) but the cross-platform usability is killer and works perfectly.

Soooo...now what? Separate video and messaging apps that have neither Hangouts NOR SMS integration? What happened to RCS? Who do they imagine is the target user for Allo? Do they think the average user gives a shit about end-to-end encryption? Do they think the average user is going to give a shit if some magical AI can write ""lol"" for them? AND you need a separate app for video calling, which *only* does video calling? And apparently it's slated to be the default messenger on Android N. It's a little late for that, don't you think, Google? You've had Hangouts out for years. It's been installed over a billion times according to the Play Store.

Who thought of this? Who managed to not only come up with this terrible idea, but actually got it approved? Who the hell approved it?

I *kind of* get the *intention* behind it: they want to provide multiple messaging services for different target audiences. Unfortunately, I don't think they have any freaking clue what those actual audiences are. Business Insider seems to be under the impression that Hangouts is for enterprise use? What???

What's the point? I'm so confused by this announcement that I can barely articulate just how confused I am.",Android,487,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4k4czm/i_honestly_find_this_whole_alloduo_thing_the_most/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2018-04-04,1522851283,Apps for great continuity between Android and macOS - Android in an Apple Ecosystem,"After having the iPhone 5s and iPhone 6s between 2013-now I finally decided to give Android a chance and the Pixel 2 xl. I haven't regretted the choice so far, though there are a few apps that I find to really help below.

One Commander Pro - macOS (On App Store)

Great for directory search and manipulation. One great plus is the ability to fully transverse the file system in Android that seems more native within macOS. The dual windowing system also makes transferring of files easy. The file transfer app from Android isn't that great, though One Commander Pro is a lot more polished for this use.

Join by joaoapps - Android

One crappy thing of using Android with macOS is handoff and the lack of airdrop and imessages. However, this can be remedied through a few third party solutions. If you utilize chrome on macOS Join seems to be the best option. While Pushbullet has more features and can be used with things such as Noti (macOS) and Firefox, the price can be prohibitive. Also, the data from ""handoff"" can be encrypted E &gt; E AES and is saved locally on your Google drive. The overall price of 4.99 for a full unlock isn't painful either. Yes this is a small developer without the weight of Apple, though the experience has been quite seamless so far.

PocketShare - Android

Wireless file transfer and directory searching via SMB can usually only be tackled with a rooted Android phone since port 445 etc is prohibited for use. However, you can designate a non-standard port for the same task. When Pocketshare was activated I was able to locate the share immediately under the shared portion of macOS or by the IP and unique port. You can also target a specific directory for sharing and authenticate for security reasons. The one caveat with the app is that it's really only useful until you pay for it. However the $2 price tag isn't that bad and you can at least test it out first. 

None of this is perfect by any means, though I found these apps really helped to form more of a cohesive setup. If you have any suggestions let me know as well.

2023-12-11,1702325310,If IMessage was available on Android devices (for a monthly fee) would consider using it?,"\*would you consider using it\*

Recently I read an article about that app ""Beeper mini"" (some IMessage for android thing) being shut down and was wondering if there is some demand for IMessage for android could Apple make additional revenue from android users if they had their own IMessage for android but for a monthly fee?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I'm team Android and I'd consider it if it was like $5 a month, but probably wouldn't go for it, and Apple would probably make it $20 a month or more. Though the issue with this is that it would make it easier for people to leave the Apple ecosystem (Decrease Iphone sales and app store revenue) and if they decided to try it it would need to price it in a way thats expensive enough to deter people from leaving and market it only to existing Android users.

&amp;#x200B;

SIDE THOUGHT: IF and ONLY IF, a decent percentage of people only have an Iphones for IMessage does that indicate an issue with Apples IPhones in the long run?  Now i don't think this would happen but what if all companies that use Android OS (Samsung, LG, HTC etc. including Google of course) agree to use some sort of standardized web based android messaging service that does every thing Imessage does? Couldnt that sway at least some of the same people away from Apple? Or do you think that would need to happen 1st before Apple tries to make a paid imessage service for Android?",Android,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/18g2t6y/if_imessage_was_available_on_android_devices_for/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

In all honesty, there's so many litttle and big things that I endured that I think I'm done. I've never had an iPhone, I couldn't justify getting one for years but I've been looking on the other side for quite some time hoping the grass may actually be greener over there.

However, I've been thinking what weird ""features"" or small irritating changes I may be surprised by that I take for granted with Android. I'm sure there are people that have used the system for a long time and tried iPhone life for a while. What's your experience like? What drove you crazy with Apple (except the obvious - I can't customize it the way I want etc)

2021-04-09,1617991521,Leaving Apple and moving to Samsung - 1 month on,"Firstly let me say I don't hate Apple. My first cell phone/mobile was the iPhone 3Gs back in '08. I had most of the new iPhone year on year after that.

Recently I started to get bored with iOS. Everything was the same, it was clean but it was Apple's phone not mine. The things I wanted out of my phone I wasn't getting because it wasn't compatible with most things. Apple also became a victim of its own ease of use, getting a new phone never felt good. Everything transferred across in seconds and the feeling of having a new phone never lasted past opening the box - once you transferred your stuff across it was the same phone with all your dumb apps, pictures and notes but occasionally with a bigger screen. So I decided to make the change and I honestly don't regret it at all.

First day or so was a little chaotic. Smart transfer took care of mostly everything, however there were teething problem as I had to get used to Android. However after a day or two this went away. Play with the settings, if you're missing a shortcut or some other function you had with Apple I guarantee you Android can replicate it, but you just need to look for it. Moving over to android my biggest consideration was the lack of iMessages, but realistically I now realise how ridiculous it was to be locked into a phone that I no longer found satisfying because of blue messages. If you're thinking about making the switch too and you're worried about this, trust me, you'll get over it quick.

If you have a lot of money, and you can afford to buy every apple product possible by all means stick with Apple. The Apple ecosystem is great and everything works. However, if you have a windows PC the compatibility between the two was always lacking. Samsung's Ecosystem is just as good, if not better. You can install Samsung flow on any windows or Android device and bring all of your devices into one ecosystem, with Apple you can expect to pay thousands for the same functionality and have to deal with all the pitfalls, peculiarities and annoyances that iOS has to offer. Android phones work and functional like mini PCs - being able to do what I can on Android is a real productivity boost and it makes work, entertainment and file sharing across devices a whole lot less of a headache. Apple's OS is not curated, its closed. Its a marketing decision to make you buy more Apple products - don't believe me? Read Jobs' autobiography or watch the movie. It was a conscious decision to lock people in with end-to-end control and no cross compatibility.

There are so many features with Samsung, so many ways for you customise your phone so it acts in exactly the way you want it to act, and does what you want it to. This isn't true of Apple. Apple's half-hearted attempt at introducing widgets are next to worthless, with Android widgets are amazing and incredibly functional.

With the specs of the devices, Apple and Galaxy are pretty evenly matched, however Samsung usually has the edge over Apple - and always for a a few hundred $/Â£ less. Everything Apple can do Samsung does too, and in some cases it does it better.

When I bought my S21 Ultra I got free Galaxy Buds and I recently bough a Galaxy Watch. I'm now fully immersed in everything Samsung and I don't miss Apple at all.

Moral of the story is to not have blind loyalty to a brand and accept less than functionality because of it. If you're paying for something make sure it does what you want it to. Also, don't stay loyal to a brand because it has prettier emojis or blue messages - that's just dumb.

*Don't know if people will find this helpful or not but I watched a tonne of Apple to Android switch videos and read a lot of reddit posts before taking the plunge so I thought I'd put my 2 cents in too.*

2015-06-18,1434661933,From love to hate of the Galaxy S6 (and Android),"I thought I'd post this to try to promote a discussion around a huge problem facing Android as a whole - experiences that just don't work. It'll probably come off as a rant, though, but oh well.

I've had the Galaxy S6 Edge for over 2 months now. My first one actually had the scratched screen defect which was instantly replaced. I *loved* it. It was fast, responsive, sleek, and felt amazing to hold. It felt like everything I wanted in a phone.

It's all gone downhill, and getting the 5.1.1 update really pushed me over the edge from loving Android, everything Android, to absolutely hating it.

 * I can't listen to music and use navigation at the same time. It crashes the navigation very frequently.
 * I consistently run into 5s+ slowdowns while Google's keyboard or launcher opens.
 * My battery life is shit. It was shit before the update, too. My wife, who has the regular iPhone 6 with a battery that's literally 800mAh less, has no problems or issues. We've traded phones for three days, and the iPhone 6 is just noticeably better.
 * ""OK Google,"" what was a killer feature on my Nexus 5, is just so buggy, slow, and inconsistent that I don't use it.
 * Typing is just a joke. Mid-typing, the screen will freeze for a few seconds before catching up with a ton of misspelled words.

I'm sure each of these problems can be solved, and I don't want help solving them.

The point I'm here to make is that **I shouldn't fucking have these problems - the phone should just work.** Honestly, I shouldn't have to deal with huge slowdowns, or shit battery, or stutters and crashes. It's just shocking that Android even **allows these problems to happen** for someone who's such a vanilla user. It makes the entire brand look bad.

I've done the tweaks, too. I've turned off VOLTE and Wifi Calling. I've disabled wifi smart connect. I've disabled all Samsung bloatware. But still, these problems persist.

I initially switched from my iPhone 4 to Android because I wanted the freedom. I wanted to put my software on stuff. I didn't want to pay out the ass for the full Apple ecosystem. I wanted to make my own apps without huge initial paywalls. But that freedom has come at a heavy cost, and I'm disappointed in Android as a result.

I just can't get the ""perfect phone."" I've tried the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Moto X, and in every case, something is lacking. Something makes me regret my purchase. Something leaves me disappointed. The only bit of disappointment I'd ever gotten from Apple was the closed-door ecosystem, **but at least then I knew what my disappointments would be**.",Android,324,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3abwxb/from_love_to_hate_of_the_galaxy_s6_and_android/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2024-11-28,1732811064,My experience with the Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem,"I was curious how well the integrations between phone and laptop would work, so I decided to test all of the relevant ecosystem apps and features. Ive included a description of each app/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. 

#Summary

* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but theres no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.
* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didnt.
* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.
* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.
* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but theres no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.
* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.
* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.
* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.

Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.

#Samsung Notes
[Samsung Notes](https://i.imgur.com/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.

Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. Its worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesnt support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https://i.imgur.com/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didnt have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.

Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasnt able to get notes to sync reliably. Its worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they cant be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https://i.imgur.com/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasnt able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https://i.imgur.com/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https://i.imgur.com/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https://i.imgur.com/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.

#Samsung Gallery
[Samsung Gallery](https://i.imgur.com/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https://i.imgur.com/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): 

&gt;Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. 

Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. Its worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasnt able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https://i.imgur.com/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.

#Multi control
[Multi control](https://i.imgur.com/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Its worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.

Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https://i.imgur.com/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldnt get it to appear reliably.

#Quick Share
[Quick Share](https://i.imgur.com/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.

Quick Share worked as expected. Its worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesnt support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Googles desktop Quick Share app](https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/better-together/quick-share-app/).

#Samsung Phone
The [Samsung Phone app](https://i.imgur.com/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.

Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and theres an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https://i.imgur.com/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.

By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts arent. Its worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesnt support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.

#Continue apps on other devices
[Continue apps on other devices](https://i.imgur.com/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. 

Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. 

#Samsung Flow
The [Samsung Flow app](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.

All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. 

[Incoming notifications](https://i.imgur.com/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https://i.imgur.com/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https://i.imgur.com/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. Its worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.

With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.

With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https://i.imgur.com/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https://i.imgur.com/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.

#Samsung Pass
[Samsung Pass](https://i.imgur.com/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.

Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works.

The advantage of SD Card FS is that a single file operation call now goes from the kernel to the hardware directly instead of having to make a round-trip to the userspace before calling the hardware. This avoids context switches and makes the operation significantly more performant.

They also talk about A/B system image updates as well as a new CPU scheduler.

2016-12-04,1480838723,"My first, amazing week with Android","I finally made my way to Android after 5+ years of iOS. After at least a year or two of slippage from Apple and their software, I felt it was time to try the competition. What I *didn't* realize, though, is how much I'd end up loving it.

For reference, I have a Nexus 6P and Google Fi. The Pixel looks great, but was too expensive to buy outright, and I prefer the 6P's design anyway. I knew I wanted Fi and a Google phone, so this was the natural choice for me. 

Today, my gripes amount to preferences and small annoyances:

* Notifications. They feel better, and the notification center is miles ahead of iOS, but when my phone is locked I can't seem to easily access them. Double-tapping and then having to unlock is convoluted. Other times, I feel like alerts aren't being properly delivered when my phone is in my pocket.

* I miss my home button. Having to grab the phone in a certain way (on the back or sides) to wake it is slightly annoying. Perhaps a ""tap to unlock"" feature would be useful. 

* The messaging situation is confusing. Hangouts, Duo, Allo, *and* Messenger. What the hell is Allo even for? It's a fine app, but I just don't understand this aspect of the ecosystem.

* Still getting used to the Google Keyboard. The customization is great, but I can't seem to type as accurately on it and the auto-correct isn't as good. It's funny, I feel like GBoard for iPhone worked a little better than my Android Nougat one.

Why I won't be switching back to my iPhone:

* The customization is amazing. I can punch in settings that I never even realized I needed.

* It's so snappy! Everything just zips into place. More than an absence of lag, the animations feel alive and exciting.

* The design is just better. Is it as polished as iOS everywhere? No. Certain Google apps show this (like News, which works but is lacking). But the feeling behind the design and how you interact with it is much better.

* My phone is working for me again. If I want something done, I can navigate there easily. Gone are the days of hopping between three apps and feeling closed off from the rest of my phone or accounts. 

* I always heard that the Android versions of apps are worse than their iOS counterparts, but in quite a few apps I've found the opposite to be true. Perhaps it's just the extra screen real estate, but apps like Pocket Casts or Spotify work a lot better on Android.  

* Google's voice recognition actually works and understands context! I said ""play Bon Iver in Spotify"" and it was able to play and control the app, even though it's not Google Play. This is not common on Siri if possible at all.

All in all, I am a very satisfied user. Please let me know of any tips or tricks that may help, and thanks for being a good community during the process!",Android,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5gei9n/my_first_amazing_week_with_android/,pro_android,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2012-12-12,1355319178,What are currently the best examples of well-designed apps for Android?,"Ever since Google launched Ice Cream sandwich about one year ago along with their set of ""Holo"" design guidelines, we've been fortunate to see a slow but steady shift in the amount of attention paid to design in our Android apps. While there are still a good amount of popular apps that could use a UI update, there are also more well-designed apps available on the Play Store than ever before. Old favorites have been updated with Holo aesthetics, and new apps have burst onto the scene sporting attractive looks and robust functionality.

Android's app ecosystem still has a ways to go before it can match the consistency and polish of iOS's offerings, but we're currently experiencing a very positive upward trend toward making the Android experience as beautiful as it is functional.

So, without further ado, I ask my fellow Redditors to list apps that they find to be the best examples of good design, with regard to both looks and overall functionality. After all, it is the cross-section of both that makes a killer app.

I'll start us off with a few of my favorites:

- [Reddit News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news&amp;hl=en) - For my money (I bought the paid version), this is the best Reddit app around both in terms of form and function. The dark Holo theme is simply gorgeous to look at and easy to read in pretty much any lighting conditions, and the action bar with the one-click dropdown menu of all of my subreddits is a godsend. While other Reddit apps like Reddit Sync and Baconreader also sport pretty pleasant UI's, nothing beats Reddit News for me in terms of features and general functionality.

- [DoubleTwist Alarm Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.alarmClock&amp;hl=en) - This was the one that popped my paid app cherry, if you will. It came seemingly out of nowhere with its sleek (albeit not Holo) aesthetics and complete feature set. It has pretty much everything I need in an alarm clock app as well as a few extras like Nap timer, Sleep Cycle-based alarms, and a slew of free alarm tones that are bundled with the app.

- [Eye in Sky Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citc.weather&amp;hl=en) - Formerly called ""Weather Eye,"" this little gem of a weather app is one of the prettiest offerings in a very crowded market of weather apps and widgets. It comes sporting multiple sleek icon sets to choose from and an array of attractive widgets. Along with its good looks are full forecasts for weeks in advance and all other bits of important weather data.

- [Dato gTasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dayup.gtask&amp;hl=en) - This was actually a rather ugly app until earlier this year, when it saw a tasteful Holo redesign that extended throughout the app and its widget. [Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks&amp;hl=en) is another gorgeous Google Tasks app that follows Holo guidelines, but I favor gTasks for its ""Quick Add"" feature and its ability to integrate with my Simple Agenda Widget.

- [inKa File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhoffs.filemanager&amp;hl=en) - File managers are a dime-a-dozen these days, but inKa's little app sports the best looks and smoothest performance I have come across. The one downside to this one is that it doesn't have root capabilities (as far as I know), but for general file management this is my top choice. The dark Holo theme looks incredible here.

- [SMS Popup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.everythingandroid.smspopup&amp;hl=en) - Being able to immediately see and reply to a text message without having to pull down the notification drawer is just plain functionally sound, and this app adds a little beauty to that functionality. It has just the right amount of customization, and the end result looks truly native to Android ICS and JB. Pretty much perfect for what I need.


I'll stop there to give everyone else a chance to recommend their favorites.

2022-08-08,1659948499,Why does no one like MIUI?,"Okay so first let me declare that before I switched to Android MIUI, I have always used apple. I have always been given hand me downs from my parents and was always clumsy with Android. 

But when it came to buying my first phone with my own money, I decided to buy a Poco running Android 12 MIUI 13. Now after my switch and some adjusting, I can say android is a more feature rich experience and I love it. 

But also, I like MIUI and always get hate for saying such. I wanted to address some of the common issues people have and see if my bias comes from only using MIUI and and my gf's pixel is the issue, or if people haven't given newer versions of MIUI a chance. 

Things I love:

-Camera app is easy to use and feature rich. 

-I love that you can swipe from the bottom top right or left to bring down different menus. (Settings and notifications) 

-I love the customisation, similar if not better than Samsung's. I think. 

-Privacy from others using your phone is great. Hidden and password protected photo and app folders built into the phone. Every app can be locked if you want. Can run a whole secret 2nd installation of MIUI by unlocking with a specific finger or password. 

-some ""bloatware"" is actually helpful. One of them is essentially YouTube premium for free, no ads, plays audio while locked, download videos etc. Other apps include shit you are already gonna use like Tiktok, Spotify and Facebook. 

- most MIUI phones practically make no money on the sale of the phone, mostly on the very small amount of ads you will see which can also just be turned off.
- uses the Google apps instead of its own crappy alternatives like Samsung. 



Things people hate and why I don't see this as an issue:

-""bloatware"" to me, I would much rather save a couple hundred dollars and uninstal a few apps or never open the few permanent ones then have no bloatware and a more expensive phone. 

-""it's heavy"" so far battery and performance has been fine for me. I am using the SD8 G1 but I don't see the OS as taxing in any way. Battery life seems to be fine overall. 

- ""it's too similar to IOS"" I have used IOS practically my whole life, and from what I have seen of previous versions I 100% see this. But receiving MIUI 13 on android 12, it really has its own unique identity that is very much more android than IOS. But IOS layout is clean,  it's just not as feature rich. MIUI has both? 

-""Chinese spyware"" okay, If true, fair criticism. But google takes all our info anyway. 

-""Ads"" All phones need to make profit. Apple restricts you to its ecosystem and taxes your purchases. Samsung often hikes it's prices to be absurd. Xaomi breaks even and runs ads to make profits. I think it's worth the savings, and the ads are really not intrusive. It's like when you download an app, and you can just turn them off.

For those unaware, pretty much all non-custom Android-OSes (especially ""Android One"") have never properly locked your phone (screen) when ""Screen Lock"" has been activated.   
This is something that has been made not-enough-noise about at the very least since year-2013:

In summary:   
You have been always able to access the power-menu and fiddle with the most important tracking / theft-recovery-related quick-settings-tiles (""Do Not Disturb, Airplane-mode, Hotspot, Mobile-Data, etc."") while the screen / phone has been ""locked"". 

Another person from where I first read about ""Cerberus Lock Screen Protector""-app has also linked / documented on this matter:

If the comment-section of that blog-post is to be believed, this page was also the inspiration to ""Luca / LSDroid"" to release / rip-away this (proper) screen locker from their software-suite. 

The screenshots of app-store-page are slightly misleading:   
Aside for the microsecond until the unlocking-screen is displayed, this app works more like a ""auto-switcher"" than than a button-disabler.   
So if you pull-down while in lock-screen, you are presented with the unlock-screen or occasionally it simply auto-screen-offs;   
assumption is same happens if one tries to hardware-shutdown the device ( power + Volume-down for 5-seconds, or something like that ).   
For reference, I am running this on ""Nokia XR20 (Android One 13)"".   
   
So yeah, I for one am surprised how this whole thing has ""flown under the radar"" and this app hasn't yet gotten more popular yet all things considered.   
So hopefully someone else finds this ""should has been baked-in from get-go""-solution useful.

2022-04-16,1650118711,OPPO Find X5 Pro - An in depth review,"**INTRODUCTION**

As some of you will be aware, my name is Glenn, more commonly (around here) known as LennyUK.Â  I was chosen to be an OPPO Ambassador and have been playing around with the OPPO Find X5 Pro for a few weeks now.

Before I dive into this review I want to make clear that I have a pretty extensive history of reviewing devices and software, I have written for many Android websites over the years and have been a very long term member of XDA Developers and was once a recognised Developer.Â  On top of all this I have owned an awful lot of devices right from the beginning of Android.

Why am I reminding you of this? Well, there appears to be an apprehension from some people to the Ambassador programme, thinking we have been told what we have to say, and will be inherently bias as a result of having use of the phone for free - all I can say is that everything I say will be my own honest, unfiltered opinion on this device and its software.

So let's get into it - The device I have been using is the OPPO Find X5 Pro.Â  The colour I have is Ceramic White.Â  It has 256GB of onboard storage with 12GB RAM.Â  This is a UK build and I can tell you already (SPOILER ALERT!) some features do differ from the devices available elsewhere including mainland Europe.

I also own the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, so I have a current generation, arguably the pinnacle of Android devices to compare this OPPO Find X5 Pro with.

**PROS**

* Aesthetically this device looks stunning, I am struggling to think of a nicer looking device, comfortable to hold too.
* Very smooth performance for normal use and gaming
* ColorOS functions and apps are largely useful and well made
* SuperVOOC charging is a game changer
* The camera is very good especially in low light or night scenes with decent features for pro photographers but its telephoto options are not quite as good as some competitor devices

**CONS**

* Beauty of the device is mostly lost when using a case, which most people will want to (and one is even provided for you)
* In indoor settings/shade the display loses a lot of its magic, unless you choose to substantially increase the brightness level
* Accessing the devices power menu is clunky and unintuitive
* Audio Speakers are not great at louder volumes
* Battery life is good but not exceptional

**UNBOXING**

I wont go into too much detail here as I have already published an unboxing video that you can find on my YouTube channel (LennyUK TV).

The key points to note is the box includes the phone, a Super VOOC 80W charger, a USB lead (USB A to USB C) and a soft touch phone case.

**SETUP**

Setup was a breeze.Â  I used OPPOs clone app to move my data from my S22 Ultra to the Find X5 Pro and whilst it took some time to do, it worked on my first attempt and without issue.

**BUILD QUALITY/DESIGN**

As stated above, the device I have been provided is the Ceramic White colour variant.Â  It is also available in Glaze Black - is the rear of the device that is coloured with the front being a full edge to edge screen design that we have come to expect from any half decent or higher smartphone these days.

I have owned white devices previously, but not all too often, with the vast majority (which I am sure you can all agree) have been black, or at a push, silver.Â  White is a nice refreshing colour to have, however, you lose most of the impact when you use a case, which many people choose to do, especially with flagship devices, as these are not cheap!

[https://imgur.com/MMX2Txs](https://imgur.com/MMX2Txs)

The back of the phone looks stunning, the white really pops and it is silky smooth - maybe too smooth (refer back to needing a case&) but in terms of looks this phone has something that many others do not - the Samsung S22 Ultra as a comparison is a big rectangular shape that has certainly been designed from a functional perspective rather than considering aesthetics at all.Â  This was certainly not the case with the OPPO Find X5 Pro, it is clear a lot of thought has gone into its design (as well as its functions).

The back is made of ceramic (yes, the name of the colour gave that away), which you might find an unusual choice, but it works, really well - probably due to the very high quality polished finish and the subtle 75 degree slope, which OPPO claim is the optimal curve for illuminating the body in sunlight or shadow - which is great, if you are not using a case&

Aside from the colour, the device has a simple but modern OPPO and Hasselblad (the famous camera brand that has helped co-create the camera on this phone, more on that later) logo in the lower right hand edge with the camera cluster in the top left hand corner.

The camera cluster sits slightly raised from the device and contains 3 lenses and a flash/LED (I will go into more details on the camera further below) with the words Powered by MariSillicon sitting between two of the three lenses.

[https://imgur.com/HYTMWtl](https://imgur.com/HYTMWtl)

Having a raised camera cluster isnt uncommon these days, with devices trying to be as thin as can be, but also trying to include powerful camera lenses that even pros could consider using from time to time but it does mean that the device cant sit flat on a desk and the OPPO Find X5 Pro is no exception - without a case, if you use the device resting flat on a desk you will notice it wobble - it is at its worst if you try to use the top left hand area.Â  However this is easily solved by the use of a case, including the case that is provided in the box with this device.

More on that case now - it is a matt black colour with a very soft touch texture on the external facing sides, the internal side is more textured, presumably to aid in gripping to the device - it fits perfectly, which I of course expected it to.

Back to the OPPO Find X5 Pro, the front is dominated by the 6.7 screen that for specs nerds, has a 92.7% ratio and a QHD+ (3216x1440) resolution.Â  It has a hole punch selfie cam in the top left hand corner and a speaker very well hidden at the top (the earpiece speaker).Â  Both the left and right hand edges curve slightly which is likely to cause issues for those of you who prefer tempered glass screen protectors, but there are many alternative options today that work great on curved screens - and I best not forget to mention, one does come pre-fitted on this device anyway.

The right hand edge contains the power button, which seems a bit silly to call a power button as its primary function, at least when the device is powered on is to do other actions (more on this later), but I suppose the name holds true when the device is off, that is the button that powers it on.

The left hand edge contains the volume up and down keys.

All three of these keys are well made, they are not wobbly or loose fitting like other devices can have, they click well and I cannot see them being a point of weakness even after long use.

The bottom edge of the device contains a centralised USB C port with a speaker grill to its right and a mic to its left.Â  Further to the left is the SIM Card tray (the device also supports E-Sim).

[https://imgur.com/HtDTOMc](https://imgur.com/HtDTOMc)

The top edge contains the noise cancelling microphone on the right hand corner.

The OPPO Find X5 Pro is very nice in the hand, at least in mine, but I do have large hands so you may need to see for yourself - it certainly doesnt feel too big for its screen size though and is comfortable to hold and use.

Its height measures in just shy of 16.5cm and is about 7.4cm wide and is less than 1cm thick (8.5mm) weighing around 218g.Â  The weight is surprising, as it weighs a fair bit more than the S22 Ultra, but you really cant tell - if I was to use just my memory of the two devices I would have bet a lot of money (and lost!) that the Samsung was the heavier device.Â  This is where the aesthetics of the OPPO Find X5 Pro really help to keep its size and weight both comfortable and manageable.

The OPPO Find X5 Pro also comes with IP68 water and dust resistance, which is what you really expect from a flagship device.

**DISPLAY**

As stated above the device has a 6.7 QHD+ display with a 3216x1440 resolution on an AMOLED panel covered in Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, currently Corning's top Gorilla Glass product.Â  The S22 Ultra also has very similar display specs and the same Gorilla Glass.

The OPPO Find X5 Pro has a full 10bit colour depth so you can utilise HDR and has a 120hz dynamic display - keeping up with the other flagships out there at the moment (although not all of those rivals are performing as well as it should be in this department) - the dynamic part, should see the display going down as low as 10hz when a faster refresh rate is not required, which ultimately helps conserve some power.

In my day to day use I have not noticed any lag or issues with the dynamic functionality of the refresh rate - I cannot say the same about the S22 Ultra where on occasions, especially when the battery gets lower, you can visibly see the refresh rate slowing or speeding up, rather than it being ready on demand.Â  The S22 Ultra also (at the time of writing this) fails to drop the refresh rate often, or very low and certainly doesnt get close to the 1hz Samsung claimed it could - the OPPO Find X5 Pro doesnt have the same issues.

It is worth noting however that firmware updates could likely fix the issues with the S22 Ultra over time.

But that is enough of specs, what you really want to know is how does it look? Well my honest answer is good, but not quite as good as my S22 Ultra, at least not unless I really up the brightness level on the OPPO, something you dont need to do to get the colours to really pop on the Samsung - and upping the brightness obviously then impacts your battery life - however, in a bright environment the OPPO can hold its own the display is clear and looks great.

Colours almost look washed out (set to Vivid mode at default colour temperature) in those dimmer settings (with auto brightness set as you would expect) which is a real shame, but this is based on a direct comparison, for most users you will be using this device in isolation andÂ  it is by no means bad and should not really be something that puts you off the device.

[https://imgur.com/yWRK0jJ](https://imgur.com/yWRK0jJ)

Some quick notes on the display software settings:

* You get choice of light and dark mode (as you would expect, it is an android device)
* Choice of 3 screen colour modes (Vivid, Natural, Pro) and 3 colour temperatures on a slider (Cool, default, and warm)
* Eye comfort mode to remove blue light
* Choice of resolution (auto, FHD+, QHD+)
* Choice of max refresh rate (High 120Hz or Standard 60hz) - both work dynamically
* You can choose to hide the holepunch camera (basically makes the notification bar solid black)

**SOFTWARE (ColorOS)**

At the time of writing this review the OPPO Find X5 Pro is running Android 12 with a March 2022 security update - a couple of OTAs have already been pushed out in the few weeks the device has been released.

ColourOS (what OPPO call their skin of Android) is version 12.1 and the devices software version is currently CPH2305\_11\_A.17

It has a full Google/Android experience (GAPPS) so you have full use of Google Apps including the Play Store.

The device does come with some bloatware pre-installed, but almost all do these days - but you can easily remove what you dont want.

The device has various apps and other features as part of the ColourOS experience including an OPPO Store, an E-SIM app designed for roaming called ORoaming and a meditation/mindfulness app called O Relax.

I have a very stressful life - I am a lawyer by day with a very very high case load, managing a department and also one of the directors of my firm - when I get home, I have a 4 and a 1 year old and 2 cats (and a wife) - all this leaves me with very little time to truly chill out and as a result I am constantly on that threshold of bubbling over into chaos from all the stress - but that is where I tend to thrive and is certainly my choice, so this is not a complaint merely just a long winded way of saying a mindfulness app is something that is very useful to someone like me.

[https://imgur.com/a/5BA9o5s](https://imgur.com/a/5BA9o5s)

O Relax on first glance has a selection of Ambient Sounds, Music and coloured noises (aka white noise etc) as well as some other sounds created in collaboration with Bang &amp; Olufsen and Jo Malone London - you can set a timer and just chill out.

If you swipe to the left you get three options: Listen, which is the default tab, Unwind and Explore.Â  Unwind hosts a selection of stress-relief games like bubble popping, deep breathing, colour manipulation or picture rubbing all with their own soothing sounds and colours.Â  Explore lets you pick an environment such as various cities around the world and here sounds from ears of those cities, that background noise that helps you zone out.Â  You can adjust how active those noises are.Â  If real cities are not for you then you can also explore sounds of an alien world (yes really!) - which is a full Dolby Atmos audio production.

[https://imgur.com/HbhP2zU](https://imgur.com/HbhP2zU)

The device also features a privacy dashboard, accessible through the settings menu that enables you to control things like access to microphone or camera (globally, as it stops all apps from using them) as well as control permissions and other things like locking or hiding applications.Â  You can also choose to have a toast popup that tells you when apps read your clipboard.Â  The dashboard itself notifies you on how often location, camera and microphone have been accused in the past 24 hours, giving you details of when they were accessed and by what applications - you can also access the same data for other permissions if you wish.

You will also see notification icons for when the camera and microphone are in use, so applications shouldnt be able to sneakily record you without at least giving you the chance to see that it is.

[https://imgur.com/a/z05lh90](https://imgur.com/a/z05lh90)

One feature the device has in the UK that it doesnt appear to have (based on my discussions with those who have the devices elsewhere) in mainland Europe (or further afield) is Omoji - this is OPPOs version of animated emoji - here you can design a face and then manipulate it in real time via the selfie camera and your own face and take pictures in various poses which can then be used as your own emojis (via insert picture or video into your various apps).

There are of course many other features of ColorOS 12, more than I can talk about in this one review, but to name a few others you have Air Gestures (a way of controlling the device without touching it, imagine if you are baking and your hands are covered in flour), always on display etc

One final feature I will mention is the flexible windows - accessed via a hidden sidebar, not uncommon to find on many devices at the moment - is a quick way to access those important apps you use often, 2-factor authentication, or password manages are two good examples - they open as a floating window you can move around, or maximise, or close - this is much more useful than multitasking where it splits your screen, its quicker and far less disruptive enabling you to quickly do what you need to do then close out back to where you were - this is definitely a function I will miss when going back to other devices as whilst they may have similar functionality it just doesnt work the same.

As an extra, I know some of you wanted to know - yes the phone does have a native call recording function.

Its at this stage I get to talk about one annoying factor - and I know OPPO are not alone in trying to mix up the norm when it comes to this, what is it? Powering off the device&Â  As I alluded to earlier, the phone has a power button, the button functions to turn the phone on when its off, or to turn the screen on and off when powered up, but it does not (in itself) control the switching off or rebooting of the device.Â  Long pressing it does not bring up a power menu (it can be programmed to do other things) - instead, and no where in the documentation that came with the phone or on the device itself (at least obviously) does it tell you this - you have to hold both power and volume up to get access to this menu.Â  You also have to hold it for a length of time that is longer than you would expect, just as you reach the point of thinking it's not going to work, then it does.

Yes, I can see the advantages of gaining a programmable hard key for other uses&but not at the loss of making switching off or rebooting the device ridiculously difficult to understand - your average user will simply not know how to do this.

**CAMERA**

I enjoy photography.Â  I am not a pro by any means and have never had any formal training, but I do spend a lot of time taking photos with my DSLR, or mobile devices, and editing them - I am not amazing, but I am more than capable of getting some magic shots if everything falls together for me (one of the other Ambassadors is an actual photographer and his work is brilliant).

I know my way around a camera and had some things planned for this review, but unfortunately due to brexit delivery of my phone was delayed and the opportunity for some great night and low light photos was missed (I had a trip to the O2 Arena, London, to see Hanz Zimmer live, would have been great shots of the gig itself but also London at night) - since then I have been very busy with my day job and battling illness so opportunities to get great shots have been extremely limited, but I have still had a play with the camera, enough to give you some thoughts and a rundown.

Anyway, the juicy bits - the OPPO Find X5 Pro boasts three lenses and has been co-developed with leading manufacturer of middle format cameras, Hasseblad, if you have never heard of them before, shame on you!Â  It has a 50MP Wide Angle Camera, a 50MP Ultra Wide Angle Camera and 13MP Telephoto Lens capable of 5x hybrid optical zoom (2x actual optical) and 20x digital zoom.

The Wide Angle camera has a 5 Axis mechanical stabilisation system that really helps with mobile photography and can get you an aperture of f/1.7 which for a mobile device is extremely low - for those of you not camera nerds, the lower this number the blurrier the background of an image becomes, what is known as bokeh - perfect for portrait photos.

The Ultra Wide has a 110.3 degree field of view and an aperture of f/2.2 which gives you great options when shooting landscapes, or city scenes.

Both of those lenses use sensors from Sony - my preferred camera sensor manufacturer.

Then what really makes this camera stand out from the crowd is the MariSillicon X NPU (Neural Processing Unit) think of it as a form of hardware acceleration enabling the cameras software to work brilliantly and do things it couldnt otherwise do and all without impacting the on the devices CPU or GPU functionality.

[https://imgur.com/0XbxqAr](https://imgur.com/0XbxqAr)

Specifically this NPU enables the device to offer something truly unique when it comes to low light or night photography.Â  You will notice that you can still truly see the colours and other details which most mobile cameras will lose without the images looking faked or over processed or without it looking like a daytime shot - because that isnt the point - you want a night shot to be a night shot - you want the viewer to know it was taken at night, but without losing any of those important details and that is what the cameras on the Find X5 Pro and the MariSillicon X NPU allow for.

When you open the camera you are greeted with the standard photo mode, the click and shoot mode, moving that bar left or right lets you pick other modes including Night, Video, Portrait or More - in More you will find access to the Hasselblad Pro mode, a Hi-Res mode, Panorama, Film, Slow-Mo, Time-Lapse, Long Exposure, Dual Video, Sticker, Text Scanner and X-Pan, another Hasselblad feature.

Pro mode offers features such as a histogram and focus peaking and the ability to shoot in RAW.

If you are after a device that can take very nice photos in almost all conditions then you cant go far wrong with the Find X5 Pro.Â  The S22 Ultra also has very good camera options and the Find X5 Pro matches or beats it at almost every step, except one, which is the telephoto option - the S22 Ultra is very very good at 30x zoom and is somewhat good beyond that too, this device cant go that far, but honestly, how often on a day-to-day basis do you need to zoom in that far?

Using the camera is a very enjoyable experience and its pro mode is one of the nicest on a mobile device I have used (Sony offers a very nice Pro mode on their devices, but it is still missing some key features that its own cameras or the Find X5 Pro have, such as focus peaking).Â  Its certainly a solid offering and highly competitive.

**PERFORAMNCE/GAMING**

One thing that really impressed me, especially after coming from the Samsung S22 Ultra which you would expect to be the best you can get at the moment, is how smooth this device is to use - there is no UI lag, no missed frames, freezes or delay - it simply reacts to your input how you would expect it to do - you might think this should be standard especially in such a top spec device, but anyone who has used a S22 Ultra should know performance isnt guaranteed&

The Find X5 Pro has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU with 8 cores and the Adreno 730 GPU clocked to 818MHz - both pretty much as good as you can get at the moment and it shows in the devices performance levels.

I wont be benchmarking or discussing those in this review, they are largely meaningless and often manipulated (yes I am looking at you Samsung!), so I am focusing on real world usage experience, my usage experience.

Anyone who knows me (or looked me up) will know that one thing I do like to do in my spare time, when I have any, is game, be that on a Console, PC or a mobile device - my current mobile vices include games by Supercell (Clash of Clans and Clash Royale), detective/escape room type games (e.g. Tiny Room) and mobile versions of battle royales (like Bullet Echo).

All the games I play have been smooth and responsive much like the rest of the performance of this device, however, no game, even those that say they can, goes beyond 60fps - however, the same can be said about the S22 Ultra, so it might be a game development issue - but that the end of the world when you know the games are not lagging otherwise - it is certainly far less frustrating gaming on the OPPO Find X5 Pro than the Samsung S2 Ultra.

**AUDIO**

I spend an awful lot of time listening to YouTube Music or Audible on my devices, including via headphones (Samsung Galaxy Buds 2, which work perfectly on this device with the Samsung Wearable App installed, I have not used the OPPO Headphones to compare) and on the device's speaker.

Whilst certainly not terrible, the speaker performance certainly isnt as good as other devices out there - the louder the volume gets the more tinny it sounds, regardless of your EQ settings.Â 

Audio performance (like displays) is something Samsung have got near perfect so I know I am judging the Find X5 Pro on a very high standard, but all I can say is, if using the speaker is your main device use, then perhaps this isnt the device for you (but certainly weigh your decision with the Find X5 Pros other features).

**ANDROID AUTO**

This might not be your use case, but is it mine - I rely on Android Auto a lot when driving, for Google Maps, YouTube Music, Audible and various EV (Electric Vehicle) apps for route planning with charging locations etc.

I had some issues using android auto on this device, although I have since found a reliable workaround - when the device is plugged in to the car, it sees the car like a PC and gives you the choice to select if you want to charge only or transfer data - selecting the latter then ensures a reliable connection to the car - selecting the former might work, but could then drop out at random times.

**BATTERY**

The Find X5 Pro comes with a 5000mAh battery - this is achieved through 2 cells of around 2500mAh each.Â  This is the same size battery that is in the Samsung S22 Ultra so I am able to offer a direct comparison given I have the same apps and same use case on each device.

Before I talk about its performance level, I want to talk about charging.Â  OPPO have developed their own fast charging system known as SuperVOOC - for this you can forget about what you think about fast charging as you are about to experience something truly special.Â  The SuperVOOC charger supplied with the device delivers 80w of electrical energy capable of charging from 0-50% in 12 minutes.

I was able to test this, as when I received my device it was completely flat - so I had no choice - and it really was amazing watching it charge up - the numbers just climb really fast whilst watching - its no longer like watching paint dry - and what's more, its real power - the device didnt discharge any faster than it would had it been (super slowly) charged via a USB port on a PC.Â  This is a game changer truly enabling you to have that rapid charge to top up a bit before heading out meaning you should never be without power (if you have your SuperVOOC charger nearby).

If you like to wirelessly charge, then you can purchase the AIRVOOC Charger (or if you pre-ordered the device you may have received one free) - this delivers 50W of charging power giving you a full charge in just 47 minutes which is very good for wirelessly charging.

OPPO Claim that the Find X5 Pro battery will remain at peak levels for up to 1,600 charging cycles, which is around double what you would normally expect to see - a very good claim, but obviously not something I have been able to test out, so I will have to take their word for it.

Now, personally I have always found battery reviews a bit useless - not because what is written is untrue, but because it is so hard to compare that with your own use case, because we all use devices very differently and in the end the only real test is comparing it from one device you own to another.

But we all expect to read about battery life, so here are some ground rules to help you out a bit.Â  I am a fairly heavy user, I have a bit of a problem and use my phone little and very often throughout the day, constantly checking for new messages or the millions of emails I receive (both work and personal), it is my contact list, my calendar, my contact with my friends and wife and kids when at work (and not in meetings).Â  I game on my breaks, I listen to a lot of audio, I have a smart controlled house and the phone acts as the UI hub.Â  Basically it controls me& but that is a story for a therapy session.Â 

What I am getting at is I have never been someone who can boast that I can get 8 hours screen on time from any device, it doesnt matter what I am using how big its battery is or how new the phone is - I always struggle to get more than say 2 hours of screen on time and the Find X5 Pro is no exception, but I didnt expect it to be - so dont base your decision to buy this device on what I am about to say entirely - on paper this is a top spec battery and as I said above, the SuperVOOC charging really is something else and largely negates the negatives I am about to say.

I can make it through a full day of my use on this device, but only just - I am down to the last few percentages before bed, when I charge up overnight - sometimes even with a small USB (car or PC) top up throughout the day.

The battery is by no means a struggle and I am yet to find myself needing to utilise the battery saving software - so I could easily stretch it much further if I needed.

But does it perform as well as my S22 Ultra, the short answer is no - I am not sure what software wizardry Samsung have put into the device, despite its major performance flaws, draining its battery takes is a real effort.

I would say that the Find X5 Pro is probably up there in terms of Android battery performance at the moment, I have not tried enough of the latest devices to be able to say that it sits in second place, but it might well do, behind the S22 Ultra - but& we have to remember that no Android currently gives better battery life than the flagship Apple devices - we will have to wait and see if Android 13 can help that at all.

**CONCLUSION**

This is a very solid, usable device which is lovely to look at (if you dont use a case) and hold.Â  It performs very well but battery life is perhaps a little shorter than I would have liked.

It outperforms the Samsung S22 Ultra in day to day use in terms of performance and is a much nicer device to use generally as a result.Â  The Samsung does have a few better areas however, but that doesnt make the Find X5 Pro a bad choice, it just means it doesnt quite match up to the top level of Samsung doing what it is literally the best in the world at - making displays and producing good audio.

Would I recommend purchasing this device? Certainly, if you are after something that looks great, is comfortable to use and just works well and its within your budget options then go for it, there is unlikely to be anything better at the moment.

Some of its other features are nice and useful but maybe not game changers but a few areas are:

The SuperVOOC Charger really is impressive, you have to see it to believe it (and I am very very tempted to put up a boring YouTube video of the device charging from 0-50%!)

Also if you are a night time/low light photographer, or a fan of Hasselblad cameras then this is certainly the device for you - whilst other devices have all improved recently on night photography and videography the MariSillicon X NPU that OPPO have developed really gives this device a proper USP.",Android,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/u4yry3/oppo_find_x5_pro_an_in_depth_review/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2023-08-07,1691440800,"Android 13's unified Security &amp; Privacy settings (AKA the ""Safety Center"") has started to roll out to non-Pixel devices","This flew under the radar, but Android 13's [unified Security &amp; Privacy settings](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F289Z0wWcAIDo3A?format=jpg&amp;name=large) (AKA the ""Safety Center"") rolled out to several non-Pixel devices in the last few months!  

So far, I've seen it on:

* Nokia X20  
* Nothing Phone 1  
* Nothing Phone 2  
* OnePlus 11  

For a bit of context, Google [announced](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/05/io-2022-android-13-security-and-privacy.html) the unified security &amp; privacy settings back at I/O 2022. With the launch of the Pixel 7 in October, Google [said](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/10/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-next.html#:~:text=you%20previously%20copied.-,You%E2%80%99re%20in%20control,-Core%20to%20your) this feature would be ""coming soon first to Pixel devices later this year, and other Android phones soon after.""  

The unified security &amp; privacy settings page indeed [rolled out](https://blog.google/products/pixel/feature-drop-december-2022/) to other Pixel devices with their December 2022 Pixel Feature Drop, but there wasn't any word on when we'd see it on other devices running Android 13.  

The feature has quietly begun to show up on non-Pixel devices. The Nothing Phone 1 received it with its OS 1.5.4 update, while the Phone 2 shipped with it, as I noted in [my Nothing OS 2.0 review](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review).  

Meanwhile, the OnePlus 11 [added the feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F28-4z3XIAEmUr6?format=png&amp;name=900x900) with its OxygenOS 13.1.0.580 update (H/T 1NormalUsername on Twitter). This isn't mentioned in the official changelog, but users have [reported it](https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1353857872026402820?parentCid=1353948670755602440) on their forums. As for the Nokia X20, I'm not sure when it received it, but a user on my Telegram group said they had it and posted [a screenshot of it](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F28-2BCWcAAcnAj?format=png&amp;name=900x900).  

Safety Center is part of the Permission Mainline module, specifically the PermissionController app. Its configuration is provided by the SafetyCenterResources app. Its presence is controlled by two flags: config_enableSafetyCenter and safety_center_is_enabled. config_enableSafetyCenter defaults to true [in AOSP](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml;l=5921?q=config_enableSafetyCenter), however safety_center_is_enabled is [a DeviceConfig flag](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/main:packages/modules/Permission/service/java/com/android/safetycenter/SafetyCenterService.java;l=392) that's controlled server-side by Google Play Services. Meaning, Google decides which devices should have the feature.  

How does Google decide what devices to enable the feature on? I reached out to Google last week to find out but haven't heard back yet, however, OnePlus may have let slip a key detail: It may be required for certain ""tiers"" of Android devices. While they were looking through logcat on the OnePlus 10 Pro, 1NormalUsername discovered this interesting line:  

    07-28 15:55:43.563  1000  5011  5011 W SafetyCenterManagerWrap: isEnabled: version is not RSA4.0 T3, don't support safety center.  

This suggests that ""Tier 3"" devices under v4.0 of the Revenue Sharing Agreement between Google &amp; OnePlus must support Safety Center. I'm not sure if Tier 3 is defined similarly in all RSAs between Google &amp; OEMs, but this may explain why it's only available on some devices.  

The Nothing Phone 2 is categorized as a ""Premier"" tier GMS device, and it does ship with a ton of optional Google app prebuilts, so it could also fall under similar terms. No way for me to find out, though!  

In any case, it's possible this feature will become more broadly available in Android 14, as Safety Center is enabled by default in AOSP builds of Android 14. It likely won't be mandatory, though, and I'm guessing many OEMs will disable it or implement their own (like Samsung).",Android,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/15kwdhy/android_13s_unified_security_privacy_settings_aka/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2018-02-12,1518451135,OnePlus Security Update,"Just received this email from OnePlus this morning. Posting for all of you that don't check your email.

Dear Insert Your Name Here,

We were recently involved in a security incident potentially affecting personal information relating to you. This notice describes what we know so far, steps we have taken in response to the incident, and actions you may wish to take to protect yourself. 

We are working to provide potentially affected customers a year of free credit monitoring, where it's available. This service means you can quickly and easily check as well as receive alerts about any changes to your credit history. Please register your interest via the following link: https://oneplus.net/claim. 


What Happened 

On January 11, 2018, we were notified of several credit card fraud cases possibly related to purchases made at OnePlus.net. We promptly took steps to investigate the situation, and ultimately determined that an unknown attacker had injected a malicious script into the payment processing page of our website to intermittently capture credit card information as it was being entered. We immediately quarantined the affected server, reinforced our systems, and disabled credit card payments for good measure. 


What Information Was Involved 

We believe that personal information relating to you, including your credit/debit card number, credit/debit card expiration date, and CVV/CSC number, may have been compromised during the incident. As noted above, the malicious script appears to have only intermittently captured customer information, so we cannot confirm that your data was compromised. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice to all customers that submitted their credit card data on our online store during the window of time in which the malicious script is believed to have been active. 


What We Are Doing 

Your privacy and data security are extremely important to us. We regularly review and enhance the OnePlus IT and cybersecurity systems and processes. In addition to investigating the incident, we have engaged an expert cybersecurity firm to assist with reinforcing the security of our systems. We also thoroughly reviewed and confirmed the security of the affected webpage before reinstating credit card payments for our website. We have also reported the incident to Hong Kong law enforcement. 

We are also taking steps to notify each individual whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident. We will continue to take appropriate steps to minimize the risk of future cybersecurity incidents. 


What You Can Do 

As a general rule, we recommend that you remain vigilant about your personal information by regularly reviewing your financial account statements and periodically checking your credit report. Every individual, whether or not their data has been involved in a security breach, can receive one free credit report every twelve months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies:

 Equifax
 800.525.6285
 P.O. Box 740241
 Atlanta, GA 30374
www.equifax.com	 

Experian
 888.397.3742
 P.O. Box 9532
 Allen, TX 75013
www.experian.com	 

TransUnion
 800.680.7289
 Fraud Victim Assistance Division
 P.O. Box 6790
 Fullerton, CA 92834
www.transunion.com


Review the reports carefully for inquiries from companies you did not contact, accounts you did not open, and debts that you cannot explain. Verify the accuracy of your complete name, Social Security number, address(es), and employer(s). Notify the three consumer reporting agencies about any inaccuracies and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your states attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If you make a report to law enforcement, make sure to request a copy of the police report, as you may need to provide copies to creditors to clear up your records. In addition, you may request that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mark your account to identify any questionable activity by submitting Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, for actual or potential identity theft victims. This form is available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf. 


You may wish to add a fraud alert to your credit report file to make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. A fraud alert is a consumer statement added to your credit report. This statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name. To place a fraud alert on your file, contact one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies at the contact information provided above. The first agency that processes your fraud alert will notify the others to do so as well. Please be aware that a fraud alert may delay your ability to obtain credit. 


You may also add a security freeze to your credit report file to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written authorization. To place a security freeze (also known as a credit freeze), contact the three credit reporting agencies at the contact information provided above. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting agency. Please be aware that using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You may also incur fees to place, lift, and/or remove a security freeze, which generally range from $5-20 per action. 


Be vigilant against phishing attacks. Some criminals may use your personal information to contact you posing as a reputable source to try and trick you into providing confidential information (commonly called phishing). For example, they might call you or email you pretending to be a trusted party and ask you to confirm sensitive personal information, such as your social security number or financial account information. Please know that we will never ask you to confirm any sensitive personal information by email or over an unsolicited phone call. If you do happen to be contacted with such a request, it is not from OnePlus, and you should not provide any personal information. For more information on phishing and on how to avoid being a victim of phishing, please see https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014. 


For more information about fraud alerts, security freezes, and avoiding identity theft, you can contact any of the three credit reporting agencies (contact information above), your states regulatory authority, or the FTC (contact information below).

2017-01-31,1485881216,I made ScanLinks to block dangerous and unsafe links on your Android phone!,"## **What is ScanLinks?**
---

ScanLinks is an Android app that allows you to block unsafe and dangerous links on your Android device. It protects you from websites that are designed to phish sensitive information like personal and financial details, host malware, show a lot of spam or try to install a suspicious application on your device.

## **Why did I make it?**
---

I made ScanLinks because we often get links from friends or strangers on messaging apps or we click on unknown links within other apps and those links may lead to dangerous content that can compromise your device's security or your personal/financial information. With ScanLinks, you don't have to worry about anything, as it will automatically block any such link directly, without opening it in a web browser or another app. The data used by ScanLinks to flag a website as dangerous/unsafe is gathered from various sources by the provider, so it's more accurate than using data from a single source.

## **How does it work?**
---

When you click on a link within another app, ScanLinks will first analyse the link to determine whether it is safe to view or not. It usually takes 1-2 seconds to scan a link so you won't have to wait for a long time! If the link does not lead to a safe website, then ScanLinks will block the URL and show a warning dialog, with an option to view the website regardless and to view the scan report. If the website is safe to view, ScanLinks will automatically open the link in the web browser of your choice.

Once set as the default browser, ScanLinks basically intercepts intents to open a website, scans it and then forwards the link to a web browser of your choice if ScanLinks determines the website is safe to view.

## **Don't browsers have their own scanners?**
---

Yes, but ScanLinks blocks the link **directly, without going through the web browser**, for extra security. You are also warned when the link is not in the database (which means the link *may* be dangerous), which Chrome or another browser won't do. The links are blocked **directly** (this is important!) if they're dangerous (flagged by VirusTotal) or suspicious (not in VirusTotal's database), which can be helpful if the link's not been detected by the browser's scanner yet and/or if the link can lead to a page which can compromise your device through the web browser.

## **How do I set it up?**
---

ScanLinks is easy to set-up. After installing the app, open the app &amp; select the web browser you want to open websites in, select the blocking setting (block w/ dialog, block w/o dialog, or no blocking) and save the settings. When you click on a link, your device will show a dialog to select an app to handle the link, select 'ScanLinks' and click on 'Always' so ScanLinks can automatically handle any intent to open an URL from an external app. That's it!

You can add domains that you don't want ScanLinks to scan to the app's Whitelist, so it's recommended you add common domains like google.com, reddit.com, etc so such links don't get scanned and instead open instantly from external apps.

2013-06-24,1372098194,Phone calls now pushed to Gmail if not answered?,"Recently I've been noticing a ringing alert in Chrome immediately after a missed phone call on my phone. Today I finally saw what it was and noticed an incoming call within the Hangouts section of Gmail. What's happening is that as soon as my phone stops ringing, the call is being transparently forwarded to Hangouts where I can then answer or decline. If answered, it will open a Hangout window where I can talk to the caller with my PC microphone. If declined, it simply pushes the call to my Google Voice voicemail.

It was my understanding that the new Hangouts currently did not support voice calls. Has this changed? Also, I love the feature, I just didn't know what was causing it. Is it purely hangouts? Does it require Google Voice? I'm just a bit confused because I hadn't heard any announcements or news stories about this feature.

Cool stuff, though. With this and Mighty Text, I literally could use my phone as if it were with me, even if I left it at home.",Android,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gzeps/phone_calls_now_pushed_to_gmail_if_not_answered/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2018-06-19,1529403820,[OPINION] Why slide out cameras are the future,"Yes, notches in the display are a problem, and sliding cameras are solution to a problem which should never have been there in the first place, but there's also a silver lining to this cloud.

Concealed cameras are a boon to the privacy cautious. This is great for people who are  worried that they're being recorded or for people who simply prefer not having cameras always pointing at them.

At the time of this post, they're only two such devices which have been unveiled, the VIVO Nex and the OPPO FIND X. OPPO here has the better approach as it has cameras on both sides sliding in and out, as well as a larger portion of the phone sliding out, which should make it more secure and more durable.

Yes, there's always a possibility of the mechanism failing, sand getting in, camera jamming and other worse case scenarios, but if companies invest in this direction, this might just help tackle the bigger issue of privacy and security.",Android,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8s7rvt/opinion_why_slide_out_cameras_are_the_future/,irrelevant,Stance: neutral,,,,,,,,
2018-11-05,1541452092,"Messenger apps (signal, Whatsapp, et al)","Please let me know if there's a more appropriate place to pay this and apologies in advance if I missed it. Double apologies for the length as well.

When I switched from my iPhone to the pixel 2 I knew there would be some difficulties regarding messaging people across platforms. I did a bunch of research and while I loved Signal for it's privacy protections (and that it would default to SMS making it viable as a one stop shop for all my messaging needs), it was lacking in features, has the least amount of people I know on it, but most concerning, not all my ingoing or outgoing messages were being received. 

Whatsapp became the easy solution because most of my. Regular contacts were on it. I then used Pulse SMS for a while before going with the default Android messenger.  Whatsapp's decision to add advertising coupled with my general distrust of Facebook has led me back to thinking about apps again.

With that as the background I'm putting these things up for discussion:

1) Google is killing Allo and going all in on messenger (with RCS). I liked Allo and would've preferred they stick with that and kill messenger by turning Allo into the Android iMessage (making it the default messenger on Android phones) and have it default to RCS and then SMS of the other person you're communicating with doesn't use Allo.

2) Google's main reason for killing Allo for messenger was the installed user base. If that was the reasoning why not make Gchat/Hangouts your main messaging app? And why have a separate damn app for Duo? 

3) all of the other non Whatsapp messenger apps have their pros and cons - signal is secure but small user base and boring UI / feature set (no archiving /pinning), telegramhas privacy concerns, Viber and Wire have their own issues. Small user base can be overcome by having a strong platform. Is it naive of me to wonder why a company hasn't taken the best of the different apps and made one killer app? 

4) does anyone envision a situation where messenger apps get to the place where emails are and it doesn't matter which one you use but you can chat across them (like what Riot is trying to do)?

5) lastly, does anyone think RCS will eventually kill SMS and put pressure on apple to support it? ",Android,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9uhmyq/messenger_apps_signal_whatsapp_et_al/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2014-01-21,1390304430,Desperate measures,"So, I dropped my old tablet one last time (Asus Transformer TF101) and after several tries, decided that I was not going to send it to be repaired. I wanted to just sell it for parts on eBay, but before doing that, I wanted to force a factory reset on it, for privacy reasons, just in case my buyer was better than me at repairing it (not very difficult since my HW skills are very limited).

The video card on the tablet was damaged, so I couldn't see anything on the screen. The mini HDMI wasn't working either, so I was left with a not so easy situation. The tablet has a CM9 ROM but was not rooted, so even though I was able to connect to it via adb, I wasn't able to gain root access, so I couldn't force a factory reset via adb.

I was able to install and run AirDroid on the tablet via adb (if someone is interested, I can tell you how I did it), but that was a dead end, since the screen casting feature of AirDroid depends on having root on your tablet.

But then I found [Droid Screencast](http://www.droidscreencast.com/) and that was the way to go. I was finally able to see what was on the screen and tapping on the approximate coordinates (sometimes after several tries) I was able to go to settings, security, factory reset and after a couple of confirmation messages, my tablet was successfully factory reset.

Hopefully this post will save someone some time...

2017-07-31,1501524876,Mobile Security Survey Results,"Hello users of /r/Android,

I am interning with VCU's Engineering Center, and I am part of a team working with Dr. Carol Fung to create an Android app called RecDroid to make suggestions regarding permissions for certain apps. Here are the results for the survey we conducted to help us in this project (the link can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6oa8py/mobile_security_survey/?st=j5sgd7tz&amp;sh=59e28011))

Graphs made from our data can all be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/d7DHe).

The first graph shows how risky users rated each app permission, with 5 being risky and 1 being not risky at all. Contacts was rated as the riskiest permission while In-App Permissions was rated as the last risky. (We are currently looking into which permissions are most often requested maliciously, so I will update this post if there are any interesting correlations between what we find there and how users have ranked permissions' riskiness)

The next 4 graphs show the basic questions we asked at the beginning of the survey to get some background information on users current view of smartphone privacy and permissions with the count of users who selected each answer. The 6 graphs after that show the demographics we collected as part of the survey, with the average expertise score of each category compared to the overall mean (the orange line).

Expertise scores were calculated using the app examples that were asked about in the survey. Responses were granted 1 point for necessary permissions (0.5 points for side features) and lost 1 point away for completely unnecessary permissions. The maximum possible score was 10 and the minimum possible score was -23 (though the lowest from our responses was -5). The final graph shows a histogram of all these expertise scores.

We then used [Cramer's V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%27s_V) to test the correlation of the basic four questions as well as demographics to expertise scores. Cramer's V gives us a V-value from 0 to 1 with 0 meaning that the responses to the given question were completely independent of expertise scores and 1 meaning that expertise scores could be perfectly predicted from the response to the question. We got the following V-values:

Do you pay attention to the permissions requested by apps you download? - 0.3474
How concerned are you about smartphone privacy - 0.4083
Would you be able to comfortably determine whether a permission is necessary or not? - 0.3403
Do permissions affect your decision to download or use an app? - 0.3387
Age - 0.3887
Gender - 0.4109
Race - 0.4690
Education - 0.3619
Knowledge - 0.3098
Phone Type - 0.5460

This shows us that none of the basic questions or demographics are extremely correlated with expertise scores, but phone type actually has a pretty high correlation, meaning there is a significant trend that Android users scored higher than iOS.

Next we tested our data for normality using [D'Agostino's K-Squared Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Agostino%27s_K-squared_test) and found that our data was indeed normal. We then used our sample mean (4.6456) and sample standard deviation (2.5333) to find a 99.98% confidence interval of (4.0279, 5.2634). This means that we can be 99.98% confident that the population mean falls between 4.0279 and 5.3634, and more importantly, we can be 99.99% sure that the population mean falls above 4.0279.

Using this lower bound as our worst case scenario and assuming a score of 7 constitutes an experienced user, 8 for highly experienced, and 9 for an expert, we find that &gt;=12.71% of users can be considered experienced, &gt;=6.43% highly experienced, and &gt;=2.81% experts. This large of a proportion means RecDroid can use crowd-sourcing for reliable recommendations, though it wont be able to rely solely on the users categorized as experts if the population mean falls somewhere near the worst case scenario.

Thanks for your guys' help in this process, every response we got contributed greatly to our results.

2014-10-29,1414603924,The case for CurrentC--it's good for consumers,"The reason is really simple: retailer-controlled payment systems draw directly on your bank account, like a debit card, but do use your credit or debit card.

CurrentC cuts out the credit card processor middle men, and makes it easier for businesses, particularly small businesses, to accept electronic payments without losing 3% to Visa. 

That's good for consumers because small businesses struggle with electronic payment fees, and it's also good for consumers because that 3% is built into the price you are paying. 

Moreover, a retailer-controlled payment system has no incentive to charge fees, because they in effect would be charging themselves.

Just to be clear, I'm not making the case for the current version of CurrentC. I'm making the case for why a retailer-driven payment system is superior for consumers (in theory) to Apple Pay or Google Wallet. 
 
Now, there are some downsides--it's very possible that the big businesses making the system could use it to throttle the life out of small businesses. There are major questions about implementation, privacy, and security. 

But as it stands, there's a reason why if you go to https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/ the list of banks is long and retailers short. Because banks and credit card companies lose money if retailers control the system. 

CurrentC in its current form IS bad news. But anything that undercuts the credit card processing companies' stranglehold on businesses is good for consumers. We pay those fees, ultimately.

2013-11-11,1384214211,"Nexus 5 KitKat vs Nexus 4 CyanogenMod, first impressions, what I miss","Here is what I miss on my new Nexus 5, coming from Nexus 4 with CyanogenMod.  I'm going to do my best to stick with stock KitKat (Android 4.4) and see if the workarounds I devise will be enough to keep me happy.  I predict that I will eventually install CyanogenMod when they release a stable CM11 for N5.

**First Impressions**

* 1) Coming from Zeam Launcher (which is still an option) I hate all the wasted space on my home screen.  The icons are too far apart, I want more stuff in the bar at the bottom, I want to be able to resize widgets.  I love the high-res screen, and I want to be able to shrink icons and widgets to make use of all those pixels.
* 2) I shot some video and wow, it looks so good on the screen.  So much detail.  I thought 720p was good enough, but I now realize that 1080p is really awesome.  Everything is so crisp.
* 3) Nexus 5 is lighter than Nexus 4.  The screen is longer along the long axis, but not wider.  It is slightly thinner.
* 4) The buttons jiggle in their enclosures, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it's not a deal breaker.  Just makes it feel cheap.  If you shake the phone, you can hear them jiggle.
* 5) ""OK Google""...  I don't think I'm going to start saying ""OK Google"" instead of just sliding the home button up.  It just takes longer, is more prone to fail, and is a little embarrassing.  Also, what a waste of screen real estate.
* 6) Screen auto-brightness sucks.  It's disconcerting to have the screen brightness change every time I pick up the phone.  The algorithm needs adjustment, favoring consistency.  Sure, when I go outside in the sunlight, go ahead and quickly bump it up to brightest.  But surely it can tell the difference between sunlight and the glow of my monitor.  And why not throw in time as well, making it favor going darker after 9PM or something.

**I Miss CyanogenMod**

Here is a list of features I miss from CyanogenMod which I really think aught to be in stock Android, along with a couple workarounds.

* 1) Adjusting screen brightness by swiping the Status Bar.  Since auto-brightness is so bad, I resorted to manual manipulation of screen brightness.  This was made super easy by enabling Settings | Status bar | Brightness control in CyanogenMod.
* 2) Quiet hours.  This feature allows you to set a start and end time between which only phone calls will cause the phone to make noise, vibrate or show the notification light.  Under Settings | Sound | Quiet hours.  The workaround is the Bedside app in combination with Tasker.
* 3) Privacy Guard.  Select which apps have access to your personal data.  Under Settings | Security | Privacy Guard.  Some apps ask for more permissions than they really need, so they can upload your data to their servers and potentially sell it.  This is utter BS and Privacy Guard is there to help.  Absent from stock android, of course.  If you know of a workaround, please contact me.  In the meantime, I just try not to install apps I don't trust.
* 4) Extra lock screen slide icons.  The lock screen slider in CyanogenMod is customizable.  You can add up to 4 links, making it easy to go right to the app you are unlocking your phone to get to in the first place.  There might be an app for this, but it probably requires root.
* 5) Extra home button slide icons.  In stock, sliding the home button up only gives you access to the Google search thing.  In CyanogenMod you can add 2 more links to apps of your choosing.
* 6) Notification Toggles.  There is an app for this, but it requires root for some features and leaves an ever present notification icon.  For now, I'll try to get used to going to the non-customizable Quick Settings grid (drag notification bar down and hit the grid icon in the upper right corner).  Long-pressing acts as a toggle for things like wifi and bluetooth, where a short click takes you to the settings for those items.
* 7) Flashlight in Quick Settings grid.
* 8) Battery as Percentage.  The battery icon in stock sucks.  CyanogenMod offers a better icon and an option to show the actual percentage as a number.

That list is by no means comprehensive.  It's just what I noticed in the first few days.  It all represents pretty low hanging fruit, which I think would greatly increase my enjoyment of KitKat without over complicating the interface.  I'm leaving out all the stuff I love about Zeam Launcher.  A lot of that stuff is in the CyanogenMod default launcher, Trebuchet, and I think it should be in the stock launcher, but if you don't like the stock launcher, just get Zeam Launcher.

2014-07-14,1405316414,WTF are the 4 most popular Android Apps?,"Ive compiled a list of four most popular Android apps based on their overall ratings. These are some of the best apps according to my expert opinion. 

Number one:

Google Voice makes it to number one on my list because it's from Google, meaning it can seamlessly integrate with any Android phone or Android device. Google voice assigns you a phone number which can receive calls on all your android devices, you also have the option to add as many Android devices as you may please. The app has a built in vigorous - yet accurate - spam filter which works like a marvel to filter out spam text messages, ultimately protecting your privacy. The app lets you make free calls internationally and send text messages. In addition, it also works on desktop.

Number two:

Viber makes it to number two on my list, because it integrates with your phone line and allows you to call and text your contacts for free - given the fact that your contacts are also using Viber. Best of all, it works worldwide, making it easy - and completely free - for anyone to stay in touch with friends and family living abroad.

Number three:

Coming in at number three is Avast Mobile security app. What makes Avast deserve fifth place? Well, for once, it has loads of features such remote wipe, secure web surfing, and a battery manager. Best of all, it is completely free, unlike its competitors - and not to mention - extremely light on your phone's processor.

Number four:

Making it to the number four spot is Folder Lock; a data privacy app which has a host of features such the capability to hide pictures, videos, documents, and users have the option to save intricate credit card details using the secure wallet feature within the app. What makes this app unique is the fact that all your private files and folders can be accessed by a single password or unlock pattern.

&amp;nbsp;

**Update - Jan 2018:** User /u/Nephiel appears to have found a workaround method that allows users to re-enable Google's NFC Unlock (Smart Lock) if they have Root Access. Details in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/dsq851j/).

&amp;nbsp;

**Update - 29 Sep:** Looks like Google have finally removed NFC Smart Unlock from the Online [Nexus](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6093922?hl=en) and [Pixel](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en) support pages. I expected this to happen at some point. Before I posted this thread I made sure there was a WayBack Machine Archive Copy. [Archive Version - 11^th - 28^th Sep-2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170911155436/https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en)
I've also created an [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/jtwHa) highlighting the changes on the page. There still does not appear to be a reason or explanation for the removal.

&amp;nbsp;

**Update - 30 Sep:** After a few days of complaints, comments and theories Google have finally given an Official explanation as to why NFC Smart Lock has been disabled for new Android logins and devices. The explanation can be found on the [issue tracker thread](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413#comment24) and in my [reddit comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/dnpi5ny/). 
&amp;nbsp;

**Quote TL;DR:** Constantly evaluate unlock mechanisms, extremely low usage, alternatives available that are easy to use, secure and have much wider adoption.


A disussion about the statement can be found in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/73ejrk/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives).

&amp;nbsp;

**Non-TL;DR:**

A Google employee recently responded on a [bug report](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413) in the [Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com) that quote, 
&gt; ""SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users. If you are not existing NFC users, the option will be hidden."" 

This comes after weeks of User complaints and bug reports on both the issue tracker and on other various [sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6p0bup/anyone_has_nfc_smart_lock_working/) and [forums](https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8/834005-no-nfc-smart-lock-anymore.html).

**Link to the Issue Report:** https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413 .

&amp;nbsp;

**Okay, So what now?**

~~Perhaps if enough people voice their concerns about this issue then we might be able get them to restore this feature or at the very least be given a detailed reason as to why it has been removed for new account sign-ins.~~

If NFC smart unlock functionality is important to you I would implore you to voice your concerns to Google as well as to your Device OEM. Feel free to ""Star"" ~~and Comment on~~ the relevant issue tracker [threads](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413) etc. 

I know that many people rely heavily on NFC Smart Unlock and use it on a daily basis. Those users are entitled to the features that they have paid for.

As the issue tracker site is not publicly viewable hopefully this thread serves as a legitimate resource for people to refer to, hence the long post here.

&amp;nbsp;

**FAQ**
&amp;nbsp;

**What is NFC Smart Unlock?**

NFC Smart Unlock allows a user to unlock their Near Field Communication Enabled Android phone using a physical token or card. Many companies sell NFC Rings or Wristbands specifically to be used for Device unlocking and authentication. NFC Smart Unlock allows an NFC Tag or accessory to act like a Physical key to access a device. This type of authentication technology is also very common in the enterprise as well as with Hotels and Apartment Building complexes.

&amp;nbsp;

**What Devices or Android Versions are affected?**

All Versions of Android with Smart Unlock are affected (5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0). The NFC Smart Unlock feature is remotely enabled/disabled by Google. Internet Access is necessary to activate All Smart Unlock Features (Voice, Face, Bluetooth etc). Contrary to popular belief the Version of Google Play Services Installed Does Not affect the availability of the feature. There has been a recent increase in the number of people reporting this issue due to users installing updates and upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo. As more users upgrade their devices in the months to come more people are likely to lose this access to this feature.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Device still has NFC Smart Unlock are you sure it's just not a Bug?**

This issue currently affects All NEW Android Device Logins. If you setup your device or signed into your Google Account in June 2017 or earlier then you should not be affected. If you perform a device factory reset or flash a new ROM Image then NFC Smart Unlock will not be available to you anymore. Currently there is no know 'fix' as this feature has been *""deprecated""* by Google.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why has this happened?**

30-Sep-17 - Google have provided an official statement regarding the removal, that statement and more information can be found in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/73ejrk/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives). 

Currently (27-Sep-17) Google have not officially provided a reason for the removal of the NFC Smart Unlock Feature. The feature was disabled very quietly and without a warning or notice to users. NFC Smart Unlock is still listed as a feature on Google's [Pixel](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en) and [Nexus](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6093922?hl=en) Online Help Documentation as of Sep 27. It is also listed in the Device Manual for New Android 8.0 Devices such as the [Xperia XZ1](https://support.sonymobile.com/global-en/xperiaxz1/userguide/unlocking-your-device-automatically/). My best guess would be it is some sort of Legal or Patent issue but as this feature has been available for a few years it does seem strange.

&amp;nbsp;

**Are there any alternative options or workarounds?**

As far as I know there are some options using third party apps but there isn't currently any known work around to re-enable the Google NFC Unlock Feature. Regardless users shouldn't have to use a third party app to gain back functionality they already had access to. Not to mention the potentially major security and privacy issues that come with using a third party app.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Does this Matter?**

Google has removed an important device feature silently without notice or warning to customers. This speaks volumes about how Google treats its customers. This also serves as a general warning to be mindful of this sort behaviour from Google. As Android Users we have a right to the features we paid for on the hardware we paid for. And if those software features need to be removed for some reason legal or otherwise then we deserve a warning beforehand and a reason saying exactly what is happening, why it is happening and what alternative options or potential resolutions there may be.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background Information/Testing/Proof** 

If you want my detailed testing and breakdown information then check post #4 on the [Issue Tracker thread](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413).


&amp;nbsp;

**Opinion**

It would perhaps be more reasonable if this feature was removed for only new Google Accounts and all existing Android users got grandfathered in but this hasn't happened. I do find the wording on the issue tracker to be very questionable. 
&gt; ""SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users. If you are not existing NFC users, the option will be hidden.""
 
I am not a ""new user"" I have been using Android since 2012 and have had a Google Account for nearly 10 years, I'm hardly a ""new user"". Even if you use the *new* device approach, I had the feature when I setup my device in June but now I do not, how am I not an ""existing NFC user"". I suspect Google plan for this to be at least a somewhat permanent change and if that ends up being the case it will really impact the companies and brands that make and sell NFC rings, wristbands and key-fobs etc. This move basically destroys a significant chunk of their business. Not to mention the investment from users in NFC Tags, Fobs and in some cases bio-implants. Fortunately for me I've only bought Stickers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Other Relevant NFC Unlock Bug Report Thread**
&amp;nbsp;

There is also another NFC Smart Unlock Issue Tracker thread where users are complaining that the NFC Unlock Feature doesn't work very reliability on their devices. This thread has also been seen by a Google Employee and they state quote ""We've deferred this [issue?] to a future release, but leaving this open for now.""

2020-01-14,1579002130,"On the ""Spyware"" Case: Samsung Proofed to Be LYING, Personal Data were SENT","This is in response to the Samsung's Qihoo 360 case. For those who don't know, there's a sensational post last week on Reddit, as a user claimed that Samsung partnered with a Chinese company Qihoo and pre-installed irremovable ""spyware"" on every Samsung phone and tablet. Long story short, I found the post to be jumping to conclusions, but Samsung's response later seemed a little fishy to me. Being a network security researcher, I went ahead and decompiled the APK myself. Though I'd like to believe Samsung, it is however proven that the Device Care app is **RECORDING IMEIs and SENDING BACK Uniquely Identifiable IDs back to Qihoo's server**. The findings I'm about to spill out can be repeated and is verifiable by anyone. Don't believe my words? Download the APK and decompile it following these steps. You will see the exact same code as me.

I uploaded the Device Care APK to the JADX Decompiler ([http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk)) and downloaded the files. Here are decompiled code in the following screenshots:  
[https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m](https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m)

Just see the screenshots yourselves. You don't need to be a tech wizard to see that **IMEI** is being fetched (3rd screenshot and 4th screenshot) and **Unique Identifiable ID** is being sent to Qihoo's servers (1st screenshot). In the last screenshot, you can even see that the CPU model, whether the user is using WIFI, the free storage space on your phone were also being sent to Qihoo's servers, but I guess that's already nothing compared to your IMEI and Uniquely Identifiable ID. Samsung is obviously deceiving the Android community, hoping we'll just take their word for it.

Among the decompiled files, there's an entire library (which served as a codebase for apps) that's called libmobilesafe360\_clear-jni-6.7.so. I also decompiled that library, using another decompiler ([https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/)). The library contains the **exact same encryption keys** (the generation seed:  70&gt;@|:CF0zÂ¬.97:M0z|ovyrM) for encrypting HTTP traffic (yup, they would rather encrypt it using their own algorithm than using HTTPS) using the DES algorithm **as** the ones that was included in **360's contacts backup application.** This DES encryption key was proven by Chinese security researchers to be easily cracked and intercepted.

The final nail to the coffin for me to find out Samsung is lying is that the User-Agent string in the packets that were sent back to the server was straight up called ""**360clearsdk**"". How could this possibly be if Samsung was using their own code and was simply ""downloading Qihoo's definition database"" as they claimed?

Last but not least, though I guess this evidence is already not needed, this is the permission that the Device Care app has access to on my phone:  [https://imgur.com/e43NJQx](https://imgur.com/e43NJQx) . Notice the ""Phone"" permission. This is a clear telltale sign for apps to gather IMEI information.

I took a look back at Samsung's statements. At first, their respond on the Korean forum Naver was this one [https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese\_spyware\_preinstalled\_on\_all\_samsung/fdggokk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese_spyware_preinstalled_on_all_samsung/fdggokk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) , which basically says only the filtering database was being downloaded from Qihoo's server. After the original post has gained notoriety and people start demanding the removal of the app, Samsung told The Verge a completely different story: "" *The storage optimization process, including the scanning and removal of junk files, is fully managed by Samsungs device care solution.* "" Note how their statement has changed. Samsung now didn't claim that the app was fully made by them, but rather using an ambiguous sentence ""...*is fully managed by Samsung's device care solution"",* which basically completely avoided answering the question directly.

Conclusion:  
Hard facts, which can be verified by anyone interested:  
1. The IMEI is being collected and Uniquely Identifiable ID was being sent to Qihoo's 360 server,  
2. The encryption key that Qihoo was using in its contacts backup app for Chinese domestic users is also used in the Device Care app. Since it uses HTTP, a malicious user can intercept the traffic, decrypt the packets following the guides written by Chinese security researchers, and retrieve your uniquely identifiable ID and IMEI,  
3. In summary of 1. and 2., this basically means that not only are Samsung and Qihoo 360 collecting your personal identifiable information (which possibly violates GDPR and many states' privacy laws in the US), they are also doing it in an extremely insecure way and hackers can eavesdrop these information.

Speculation:  
1. Since this issue has been brought up time after time before (though none has reached this time's popularity), Samsung quiets down the controversy by lying again and again. They probably bet the users are not technically proficient enough to decompile the code themselves.

Last but not least, yes, this is a new account, but a throwaway one. I am a network security researcher at a major international InfoSec company, and decompiling code may violate IP laws and perhaps a ton of ToS. I simply want the truth to be out there. I have also sent the above findings to various major media outlets. I just hope that Samsung could stop lying to the r/Android community, and tell us the entire truth.

2016-03-06,1457258985,"Let's clear up the confusion regarding storage in Android once and for all, including adoptable storage in Marshmallow.","**Summary (read the gory details for the whys and hows)** Basically, users have access to a single folder, /storage/emulated.  It's the one that contains directories you should be familiar with like 'DCIM', 'Music', 'Downloads'.  This folder may point to your true internal storage or an SD card in adoptable storage mode.  Unfortunately, this folder is called different things like ""sd card"" due to history of Android which is what causes confusion; just ignore what apps choose to call this ""home directory"" for now.  SD cards or OTG drives before Lollipop, called ""portable mode"" in Marshmallow function more like a removable flash drive with your laptop: they're not considered your ""home"" folder and apps often don't even offer the option to read/write to portable storage.  In general, it should be fine to leave the SD card in portable mode if you have 32 GB+ of internal storage.

If you have less than 32 GB, you may consider adoptable storage.  The caveat though is you'll either see your internal storage or the adopted SD card but never both simultaneously.  This may seem like worthless but remember apps can continue to be individually placed on internal storage or on the adopted SD card.  This arrangement can be simple to think about if you consider your internal storage to be your home for your apps and your giant adopted SD card to contain your files (along with any exceptionally large apps).  Contrary to what everyone likes to say, Google implemented Adoptable storage pretty well because you can't simply merge two storage devices without risking the integrity of the filesystem.  ~~It's not slow, either, at least on a mid-range device like Moto G.~~ It doesn't feel slow on normal apps.  Large games/app placed on adopted storage may load a little slower.  User choice is good; adoptable storage shouldn't be removed from any device, imo.  Make the option well hidden, maybe, but don't remove it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Gory details**
First of all, I want to say at the outset that the Android storage system is a tragedy.  It's a miracle it somehow still works today.  There are too many partitions, too many folders, and too many locations to store files.  Android doesn't even break down your used storage properly - my used space + my free space never adds up to the total available space.  There have been more breaking API changes in the Android SDK regarding storage than I can keep track of. 

Naturally, there is a lot of confusion regarding storage in /r/Android.  With adoptable storage to add to the confusion, some of the things people say are downright wrong.  I wanted to make a thread that presents the facts once and for all.  I'll explain in terms of how it works on my Moto G 2015 (XT1550).  It has a real SD card that I've been using for adoptable storage for the past two months.  I've rooted my device for exploration purposes, but I'll limit my explanation to how it would behave on a stock device.  I'm reasonably confident in the overall picture I've gathered, but I realize my knowledge incomplete, so I welcome any corrections.

My phone has 16 GB of storage.  I suspect this actually means ~~16 billion bytes~~ 15,758,000,128 bytes of storage (I checked), which translates to only 14.7 GB since the OS uses 1024 for the conversions (1024 bytes = 1 KB, 1024 KB = 1 MB and so on...).  Henceforth, I will refer to storage when calculated based on 1024 as MiB and [GiB](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte), etc...

Of the 14.7 GiB, only 11.92 GB is available to the user, though.  This is because the overall storage of the device is sectioned off into many partitions (there are 42!!!), only one of which you, the user, directly has access to (the /data one).  I'll list some of the important partitions:

* /system - 2.3 GiB (ext4 filesystem): This is the ""ROM"" of the device.  It basically contains the Android OS and is the bulk of what's updated when you get software updates.  It is mounted as read-only and can only be officially written to by an update that is cryptographically signed by Motorola (unless you ""unlock"" your bootloader).

* /cache - 256 MiB (ext4 filesystem): This, as the name implies, is a partition used to store temporary files.  Note that this is different from cache files stored by apps, however.  When you look in your storage break down in the settings screen of Android, the cache used by applications is not this partition.  That lives in the /data partition.  /cache is not even readable by applications.  I suspect it's used by the system for its own purposes.  Would appreciate any explanations you guys can offer for this one.

* /data - 11.9 GiB (Flash Friendly filesystem): The is the userdata partition.  It's what the user can mainly manipulate.  It contains your user-installed apps (and the updates to the system apps) and almost all your app data.  I'll get to that almost part in a bit.  Data that an app stores inside your /data is guaranteed by the OS to remain private, in the sense that no other app or the user can access it on an unmodified device (disregarding the ADB backup/restore feature for apps and data).  See appendix I regarding all the stuff inside /data.  The part important for this guide is that there is just one folder - /data/media/0 - that is exposed to the user and apps as the ""usb storage"" or ""internal storage"" or ""internal sd card"".  It's the root of the folders we've come to know and love like DCIM, Music, Downloads, etc...  Files stored by the system under /data that are not under /data/media are not visible to users.  You can only reclaim that space by a factory reset.  I'm still looking at what kinds of logs might be stored under /data and how quickly they grow, consuming precious internal storage.


Whew!  They add up to roughly 14.5 GiB, just 200 MiB shy of my device's 14.9 GiB.  It doesn't stop here, sadly.  There are more partitions, such as the cell modem, fsg and more that each take a (small) slice out of that remaining 200 MiB.  I'm not sure what they all do but there are a total of 42 of them!  An interesting partition is /persist.  While I'm not certain about this, I suppose this partition is what allows features like device protection to work even across factory resets.  Factory reset only wipes the /data partition, so /persist, well, persists.  Users and apps, as expected, can't access /persist on unrooted devices though.  I hope this part shows users why they have less space than the advertised amount.  It is not ""lost due to formatting"" - that is only tens of MiBs at most.  It is mostly [a little shady advertising](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Consumer_confusion) carried over from the HDD days of computing and the fact that some of your device's space is reserved for other partitions - you never even see those files.


**SD Cards (Portable Mode in Marshmallow)**
  As you may have noticed, I haven't said a thing about SD cards yet.  This is because they are treated completely differently.  When I use my Moto G without a physical SD card in the device, the OS still simulates an ""internal"" SD card.  This ""internal"" SD card is accessed via the /storage/emulated directory (which contains numbered directories for eac user).  So a file manager is actually browsing /storage/emulated/0 when it's looking at user storage.  This directory actually is backed by data in /data/media - /storage/emulated is just a mount point.  When I do put in a physical SD card, it is mounted at /storage/53D-DS32 where 53D-DS32 is just some unique identifier for the card.  User-installed apps can not write any storage outside /storage/emulated/0 so when you want to capture pictures to your external SD card using a downloaded camera app, you have to ""select the SD card"" in an additional prompt - this is since ~~KitKat~~ Lollipop ([thanks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/496sn3/lets_clear_up_the_confusion_regarding_storage_in/d0pw8od)) I believe.  When you use an SD card in portable mode, you essentially have two locations to store user data: /storage/emulated/0 (the internal storage) and /storage/53D-DS32 (your SD card).  This is a CHORE to maintain.  I hated it.  You're always wondering whether this application is storing data on my internal storage or on my SD card.  And applications usually don't even offer you the option to decide where to store user data (I'm looking at you, WhatsApp).  The only reasonable way to use an SD card in portable mode on Android is just use it for Pictures and Music.  If your device has limited internal storage and you want to download lots of apps, tough.  Your SD card wouldn't help you before Marshmallow (see Appendix 3 for a severely crippled version of ""move app to SD"" Android had before Marshmallow).  Apps can no longer be moved to the SD card if you're using it in Portable Mode in Marshmallow. 

edit: As /u/alexfrias points out, some OEMs are allowing apps to be moved to SD in portable mode on Marshmallow.  So, it depends on your device.  It seems like since both Moto phones and Android One phones don't support moving apps to SD with portable storage, this is how it is in vanilla Android.  Also, files on portable storage are visible to all users on the device.  Files on internal storage or adopted internal storage are private to each user.
  
**Adoptable storage**
  When you adopt an SD card as internal storage, however, all hell breaks loose.  No, I'm just kidding it's actually quite simple.  The user is promising Android that ""I won't remove this SD card from the device; please integrate it with your internal storage.  I understand that if I remove the card, I don't expect my usb storage data to be there or some apps to work properly"".  
  
  But, the physical reality is that the SD card CAN be removed and SD cards do fail prematurely sometimes.  So, Google couldn't actually just combine the SD card with your device's internal storage.  It wouldn't work. Think about it.  If the card failed or a curious user removed the card just to see what happened (that would be me), NO file under /data (your userdata paritition, remember) would be guaranteed to be available.  In fact, removing the SD card could cause such file corruption, that the only solution would be wiping the filesystem under /data and starting over (factory resetting the device).  Clearly, this is not a viable route.  Your PHONE couldn't even be guaranteed to be stable enough to call 911 this way if the SD card failed just at the wrong time.  
  
  The only other way to ""adopt"" the SD card was to keep its filesystem separate from /data and offer the user choice of where to store what.  This is exactly what Google has done.  They give you an option to keep apps (everything in /data/app/package.name) and apps' private data (/data/data/package.name) on internal storage or the adopted SD card.  One thing that I don't like is that ALL apps are not movable to the adopted SD card still.  No system app can be moved, which makes sense.  But even for user apps, it seems like the developer has to mark the app as ""movable to SD"" in the same as they used to for the Move to SD feature until Lollipop.  It's opt-in, basically, from the developer's side.  I don't like this, because the user is already promising not to remove the SD card.  They'll understand if apps are unavailable/don't work properly without their adopted SD card.
  
  With the ~~""usb storage""~~ ""user-accessible storage"" (the /storage/emulated folder with DCIM, Music, etc folders) aspect of your data, Google did something reasonable.  Instead of forcing the user to pick for EVERY file whether they want it stored in the device's internal storage or the adopted storage, they simply made the internal memory unavailable for storage.  That is, /storage/emulated is mounted to point to your adopted SD card and your previous internal storage data that actually lived in /data/media is moved over to its new home on the SD card.  This gives the added benefit that there is NO ambiguity where apps are storing user data.  It always goes to the adopted SD card.  See appendix 4 for my hunch on why they encrypt the adopted card.  

edit: There's still a little confusion on adoptable storage.  I'll add the minute details to appendix 5.  They are quite complex and don't really change the overall concept. Suffice it to say, with adoptable storage, when you move an app to SD, all of its code and data is moved to SD, unlike pre-Marshmallow.  If you read appendix 5, you'll there is one exception, though.


**Appendix 1 - The various folders inside /data**
You can not look at the raw files and folders inside this partition without rooting your device.  I'll list some of the interesting ones:

* /data/app - This contains all user user-installed and updated system apps.  Each app gets a folder by its package name (org.mozilla.firefox).  Inside the folder, there is a base.apk which is what you download.  A lib folder for any libraries.  There is also, curiously, on devices with ART, an ""oat"" file.  This is the compiled version of the app.  The oat file is usually as big as the apk and lib combined.  However, space consumed by oat files is not counted by my Moto G when looking at the storage &amp; usb section of settings.  ***This is absolutely ridiculous.***  My apps are effectively consuming twice the space that the phone tells me they are (before factoring space consumed by app data) and I had no idea where my space was going prior to rooting it.

* /data/data - This contains the application's private data that you can ""clear"" from the app management screen.  It also gets automatically delete when you uninstall the app so it's not a good candidate for storing data to persist across app installations (think chat apps like WhatsApp).  This is why apps many times choose to litter the root directory of the user storage with the crap instead of storing it in the system managed directory.  There is no way for an application to know when it's about to be uninstalled and save some of its files, so they dump them all into user storage.

* /data/dalvik-cache - This contains the dalvik VMs byte-code that is required for your app to run pre-Lollipop.  Starting with Lollipop, it contains oat files that are binaries for ART.  They just didn't bother to rename the directory.

* ~~/data/tombstones - This contains the crash reports when your apps stop responding.  I guess this folder will also grow over time, consuming increasing amounts of space until you reset your device. Since I just rooted my phone, I can't be sure about this though since apps haven't crashed yet.  Somebody else may have better information about this.~~

* /data/media - Ah.  Here we are.  This contains the files that you see when you use a file manager.  You don't even see your entire userdata partition!  Just one folder in it. Actually it's just one folder inside /data/media, typically /data/media/0.  You see, Android is a multi-user operating system now.  So, there have to be boundaries between how much data users can share and see.  Any and all apps are shared system-wide.  They are updated everywhere even if one user updates one.  But, the user data is unique to every user on the device.  This includes the app's private data in /data/data and the ""internal SD card"" the user can see with file managers.  So, the first user of the device will see /data/media/0, the second one will see /data/media/1 and so on...  In fact, you don't get to see /data/media/0 directly either (remember the user and apps have no access to /data)!  It's mounted to a different location (/storage/emulated) via the External SD Card Filesystem.  This loop-back mount filesystem is what enforces application permissions such as WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE from the SDK or the user-configurable ""storage"" permission in Marshmallow.  There is one more folder in /data/media.  It's /data/media/obb.  When you download huge games that download ""additional data"", this is where it goes.  It can not be user-specific, since it's application code (or app resources like artwork but whatever).  It's curious to me why the obb folder lives in /data/media instead of just /data but I suspect that may be due to historical reasons since obb folder used to live on the first ""SD Card"" of the device (whether that was internal storage or an actual SD Card) before multi-user came along.

**Appendix 2 - App data stored on SD card**
   Your device's ""usb storage"" has a folder called 'Android' on it.  You can see it in any file manager even with an unmodified device.  This folder is meant to hold app data that developers don't mind exposing to the world.  Applications don't need any special permissions to write to their special folder inside 'Android'.  Note that while other applications CAN read data that one application puts in its 'Android' folder on the SD card, it's not meant to be used to share user files like pictures and music.  App data inside the 'Android' folder is still deleted when the application is uninstalled.  Google used this folder as a way to provide reprieve to users that had limited device memory but lots of SD card space before the adoptable storage feature in Marshmallow.  The idea was that if the application didn't care that its data could be read by other apps and the user, it could put files on the SD card instead of straining the limited device storage.  This was perfect for streaming music applications, for example, that supposedly encrypted their cached music files anyway.  Now that adoptable storage is here, it is my opinion that it makes little sense to store app data this way and it should be phased out in future Android versions (causing yet another breaking API change with regards to storage...).  This is because the SD card is either being used in adoptable storage mode, which means the user can move the entire application and its private data to the SD card anyway.  Or, the SD card is being used as Portable Storage (more akin to how you'd use an SD card in your laptop or something).  This would make it a poor location to put application data on since the user might remove the card at any time.  Moreover, lots of apps just dump data to their special 'Android' folder on the first SD card, which is usually the device's internal storage simulated as an SD card anyway so the benefit of saving space on the device is gone.  See why it's confusing?  We're better off without it in Android N.


**Appendix 3 - How the native ""move apps to SD"" feature worked before Marshmallow**
   Before adoptable storage in Marshmallow, Android allowed apps to be moved to the SD card in a limited capacity.  Only if the developer marked their app as movable and only a FEW of the app's files would be moved over.  Specifically, the apps' obb files always stayed on internal storage and they are some the most space consuming files!  Moreover, apps frequently moved back to internal storage when they got updated from the Play store.  This feature was more of hassle and I rarely bothered with it.

**Appendix 4 - Why encrypt the SD card**
   Before adoptable storage, when Android moved an app to SD the way appendix 3 describes, it would create a folder under .android_secure on your SD card.  The app's files under .android_secure would be INDIVIDUALLY encrypted to maintain app privacy because an SD card can always be browsed on a computer.  Remember, Android guarantees app data stored in /data/data is private to the app on an unmodified device.  I guess this isn't very good for performance.  With adoptable storage, they needed to store all of an app's files and private data on the SD card.  They could have done this with just formatting it as EXT4 but remember, an SD card can always be pulled out and put into a laptop.  They didn't want to expose apps' private data this way probably, so they chose to encrypt the entire device.  See this excellent blog post on recovering the encryption key for an adopted SD card: http://nelenkov.blogspot.in/2015/06/decrypting-android-m-adopted-storage.html  You'll need to be rooted, obviously.

**Appendix 5 - More on adoptable storage**
  The layout of the SD card once it's adopted as internal storage looks a lot like the /data partition.  The adopted SD card is actually mounted at /mnt/expand/$UUID.  Some folders within this directory:

* /app: Equivalent of /data/app from appendix 1 for the apps you move to SD card.  This includes the apk, libs, and the compiled oat file.  Individual apps and their data, can be kept on internal storage or moved to the SD card if allowed by the developer.  You're not forced to place them all in one place.  If you do choose to move an app to SD, all of it and its associated data goes to the SD card.

* /user/0: Equivalent of /data/data from appendix 1 for apps you move to SD.  So this means an app's private data is also moved to SD.

* /media: Equivalent of /data/media from appendix 1.  This is where it gets interesting.  After /u/nandhp inquired in his [comment](//www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/496sn3/lets_clear_up_the_confusion_regarding_storage_in/d0poei1), I looked into it more.  I admit I completely forgot to look at this part the first time.  You actually have the option to host the contents of /storage/emulated (the 'user-accessible storage' of your device as seen by file managers) on either /data/media (the device's internal storage) or /mnt/expand/sd-card/media (the device's adopted storage).  It has to be one or the other - you can't pool the storage for reasons mentioned above.

So, you see, an app is completely moved to SD, unlike previous implementations of the app to SD feature in Android.  The only exception here is (it's complicated...) the obb files.  All apps' obb files reside in /storage/emulated/obb.  So, if your /storage is pointing to the internal partition, all apps' obb files will reside on internal storage.  If your /storage is pointing to the adopted storage, all apps' obb files will be on the adopted storage, regardless of whether the app itself is on internal storage or the SD card.  While this decision to house obb files under /storage is odd to me, it shouldn't matter much because I think the most common use case will be to shove a huge SD card in the device and use it as your /storage/emulated.

So, is it worth it?  Yes!  I just threw a 64 GB card in there and adopted it.  You have to pry open the water-resistant back cover to access the SD card on the Moto G, anyway, so I'd never remove it.  If I want to transfer data, I just use a USB cable or something like Air Droid.  Now, I don't have to worry about if I'll run out of space while shooting a 1080p video, for example.  Games can usually be moved to SD also, along with their obb files so I effectively have infinite space for apps, pictures and music.  It works well.  Is it slow?  Not really in Real World Usage - though I may be a little more forgiving on the .5 second delay in load times than the ones sporting an S7...  The only downside, as I mentioned, is that developers still control whether their app is movable to SD.  I don't agree with this decision on an adopted storage device and hope it gets changed in the future.",Android,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/496sn3/lets_clear_up_the_confusion_regarding_storage_in/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2018-03-06,1520366191,PSA: Alcatel is adding ad-supported applications in security fixes,"Some months ago, Alcatel has started replacing their default applications with ad-supported applications. This happened in a somewhat ""covered"" way, since these new apps are taking over the spot of the regular applications (for example, the phone's Gallery is replaced by an application called ""Candy Gallery""). Users that have auto-updates turned on (which is the default for these apps) are finding themselves with entirely new ad-supported applications that are being installed without their explicit consent, since they're directly replacing the default applications.

Several of the phone default applications, which are bundled with the phone and can't be removed, have been replaced so far. These are the ones I've noticed:

- Gallery 

- Launcher

- Sound Recorder

- Weather

- File Manager

The way how this is being done, along with the low quality of the new applications, is prompting a series of 1-star reviews on these apps. Users are also disabling auto-updates to prevent future replacements, and are reverting to the default application versions that were bundled with their devices. 

However, this seems to no longer be possible. Alcatel is now pushing a new security fix for the Idol4. Concerned that there's an indication of app updates in the release notes, I've contacted Alcatel to check if these new applications are bundled with it. Their response confirmed it and they advised that, if I don't want them installed, I should simply ignore the security update.

I hope someone with decision power at Alcatel will take a moment to think about what they're telling their customers to do. They're telling people to ignore security fixes if they don't want new ad-supported applications installed in the phones that they bought. Adding these applications the way they were was already a breach in customer confidence, but adding them as part of a security fix... I don't know what to say. I was a happy customer until this happened, but I won't buy another Alcatel phone after this. I still think this is a good phone hardware-wise, but what is being done software-wise is a disgrace.

From what I've seen around, the same thing is happening with Idol3 devices.

--- EDIT: ---

Here's the replacement applications list:

[Candy Gallery](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tct.gallery3d)

2014-06-08,1402261689,What latest changes to Play Store app means for privacy,"**TL;DR** version: Google did just something very very stupid that affects all Android users.



Googles latest changes to the Store app was discussed very briefly on reddit this week (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/27g33v/security_warning_android_play_store_does_not_ask/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/27gsqn/how_to_find_the_hidden_new_permissions_when/) ). But it never got the attention it deserved.



To personally test what these changes meant, I created and published an app on the Play Store. This is what I found out in the process:

1. Permissions are divided into groups. If you approve one, you have approved all of them. 
2. Unfortunately, most groups contain at least one ""innocent"" or common permission that many apps on the Store use next to some more nasty ones.
3. Some permissions are outright hidden from the user and automatically approved. For example, the permission to access Internet. That's right, your flashlight and live wallpaper can now access internet.

**The experiment** 

The application I created used the following permissions in the first version:

    android.permission.GET_TOP_ACTIVITY_INFO 
    android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS 
    android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION 
    android.permission.WRITE_CALL_LOG 
    android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE 
    android.permission.SUBSCRIBED_FEEDS_WRITE 

Which is really not much worse than popular apps like [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.talkingben). Next I created a new version with these additional permissions, all out of the same groups as the ones above:

    android.permission.READ_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS 
    android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE 
    android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
    android.permission.ACCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS 
    android.permission.READ_SMS
    android.permission.RECEIVE_MMS 
    android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS 
    android.permission.SEND_SMS 
    android.permission.WRITE_SMS 
    android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE 
    android.permission.MOUNT_FORMAT_FILESYSTEMS 
    android.permission.MOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS 
    android.permission.SUBSCRIBED_FEEDS_READ 

As you can see, some of these are really nasty. For example the ability to format your filesystem or to make calls and send SMS without you noticing. Also, while at it, I added these two ""silent"" permissions (the second one is actually quite harmless)

    android.permission.INTERNET
    android.permission.WAKE_LOCK

I pushed the new version as an update, and guess what? The Play app swallowed all these dangerous permissions and updated my app without question ( [proof](http://imgur.com/a/we8yJ#l6L8Pqp) ). The whole process has been documented [in this imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/we8yJ). I would love to hear someone from Google explain to me why they did these awful changes.

2016-04-16,1460840716,My thoughts on why it might not really matter what mobile OS you use in 2016,"Crosspost with /r/apple and /r/android

Disclaimer: This is a bit of opinion. If you don't agree with my view, that is completely ok, just understand that this holds subjective content.

I'll start off with a summary as to why I decided to make this post. So late last year, I had my phone (A Motorola Moto X 2014) on my kitchen counter while I was feeding my infant daughter. While trying to feed her as she was persistently fussy, my arm knocked the phone off the counter and onto the tile floor. The result was, unfortunately, [not pretty](http://imgur.com/O0g4hEf). Being a broke college student, that left me in an awkward position. Pay way too much to either have it fixed, buy a new phone outright, or wait a few months for an upgrade. I decided to wait for the upgrade, and while waiting I found myself in possesion of two phones with what some consider competing OSs. In this little review, I will talk about my experiences with using both iOS and Android from the view of an average Joe.

**[Let's meet our contestants!](http://imgur.com/C3LMNsW)**

Now I'm not magic, or very rich, so I had to do with outdated hardware on both ends. For iOS, I used my friend's old iPhone 4s (2011) and for Android I used my wife's original Motorola Moto G (2013). Now this review will mainly focus on software, which means I will be focusing on how it operates, not how well it operates. So I will try my best not to let each device's hardware limitations get in the way. Each phone was running [the latest software available at the time](http://imgur.com/hHlmyIF). I should note that the Moto G never officially received the Android 6.0 'Marshmallow' software. But Android is the king of customization, so I was able to install a copy of Android 6 on the Moto G via the custom ROM scene (Resurrection Remix ROM to be specific).

And this is one complaint I have about Android. The updates. If you're unfamiliar on how updates work, let me try to explain it to you. Let's say Apple makes a soda (the iOS update), and they wanna give it to the world. To do that, they send it through a pipe and directly into your cup (your iPhone). For Android, Google will make the soda, and then send it to a distribution resivoir. From there, the makers of the cups you'll drink from will take the soda and add on and change it so that you're getting that cup maker's idea of the best soda. Then, if you're in the US, the cell network providers, let's say straw makers, will make even more additions to the soda so it will taste what they consider the best coming through their straws. This is a problem because by the time you get your soda, it may be something completely different than what Google intended, and can leave a bad taste in your mouth.

**[Navigating Apps](http://imgur.com/zEOT7ZG)**

Starting things off I'll talk about what everyone does, navigate through their phones. Apple takes the simple approach, meaning all apps are strung out across your home screens, and the best you can do is organize them by icon order or in folders. This isn't as much as an annoyance as most will let on, but it's still nice to have an [app drawer](http://imgur.com/Hutsl3B). Speaking of home screens, this is where most Android geeks like to brag. A friend of mine once said about Android, ""The reason most people love Android is because you can customize it"". And she isn't wrong, you can change almost anything about your Android experience, including your home screen experience. This means the user is allowed to download and run entirely different home screens, dubbed launchers, at will (I'm using the Sony Marshmallow concept launcher in the images above).  But not everything can be changed, much like the [recent apps switcher](http://imgur.com/miHpAvU).  It's funny to me that with each recent generation of innovation in tech, the recent apps screen on both platforms look very similar. Both are a carousel of pages or cards, to dismiss an app on each requires a swipe perpendicular to the scroll axis, and both are pretty pleasing to look at.

I know I said I would ignore hardware as much as possible, but this is where it can't exactly be ignored. The infamous home button. For Apple, they use a singular physical button which can (in newer phones) act as a finger print scanner. For Android, most phone makers use the 'stock' approach and have three on screen navigation buttons: Back, Home, and Recent. How you use these buttons is up to you, but I have to give props to Apple for making one button do so much (Single press for home, Double press for recents, Long press for Siri, and a Double Tap to lower the screen on bigger iPhone models). Android shares the long press on home, but it launches a service called Google Now on Tap, which we'll talk more about later. The one button iPhones don't have is a proper back button, but somehow I like the iPhone method of going back a lot more. The OS implements a swipe to go back gesture on most apps, and replaces the signal indicators with a ""Go back to (insert app here)"" button. On Android, the back button does all of this, but hardly is it consistent. Each app chooses how it wants to use the back button, and often times linking between apps is a pain. But enough about that, let's move on to another important aspect about our phones.

**[Information at a glance](http://imgur.com/DPIButC)**

Notifications are the things that keep us informed about what's going on in your life. They also remind us during class that we forgot to silence our phones. The way each platform handles notifications is vastly different, and I have to say I prefer Android's iteration on this one. Both OSs display your notifications on the lock screen, but Android's is a bit more practical. With Android, your lock screen is your notification shade. That means that if you open it dismiss a notification, it will disappear on both lock screen and notification shade. If you get a notification in Android and turn the screen off, it will still show on the lock screen when you turn it on. On iOS, your lock screen will only display the notifications that have arrived since last turning the screen off, meaning unlocking the phone and turning your screen off will clear all lock screen notifications. And annoyingly (to me) dismissing a lock screen notification will not dismiss it from the notification shade. The way each platform keeps you reminded of notifications is vastly different as well. In iOS, they will display a number badge next to the app icon on the home screen, where as Android will show a small icon in the status bar to keep you reminded no matter what screen you're on. One annoying thing I find about Apple's take is that clearing a notification from the shade will not clear the app badge, and in some cases vice versa (opening the app to look then going home will not dismiss the notification from the shade in certain apps).

But notifications aren't all. Next, let's talk about [widgets](http://imgur.com/xIPhvE3). This is something Android has had since the beginning, and has always gotten right. Android allows you to place small or large interactive sections of information right on your home screen. Apple did later implement this into their OS, but it's limited to the notification drawer and doesn't have as broad of a third party support.

Alongside the notification drawer and widgets is the [quick settings drawer](http://imgur.com/ar7fLXj). The way iOS implements them is in a pull up drawer from the bottom of the screen, and offers some basic toggles, as well as a media player. In Android, the toggles are a second swipe from inside the notification drawer, or a single swipe using two fingers from the top of any screen. You can also change and reorder the Android toggles in a hidden 'system ui tuner' in settings. Both get the job done, even though some might consider Android's implementation a little ""harder to reach"".

**[Idk, just Google it](http://imgur.com/rzAljvb)**

So let's get this straight. Google wins no matter what platform you pick. Google provides search results for both platforms. Google makes Android, so you're going to get the best of Google there. Siri however was, of course, the OG personal assistant. Unfortunately, due to hardware, I was unable to test the 'Proactive' feature of Siri introduced in iOS 9. From what I've read, proactive Siri is a smarter Siri that offers suggestions of news, contacts, apps, and searches based on what you're/doing where you're at. It also adds to Siri's list of app compatible voice commands. Feel free to correct me here.

Earlier I said I would come back to Google Now on Tap. Well I'm coming back to it. What it does is it opens up a dialog with different cards for Google searches based on what's currently on the screen. It's not 100% just yet, but it's still pretty cool. I'd say I prefer Google Now on Tap, but I have no experience with proactive Siri so I cannot make a fully educated opinion here.

Something to note: I asked both Google and Siri when the iPhone 4s was released. Google have me an exact date, while Siri just told me to go look it up on Apple's website. Thanks Siri.

**[Media consumption](http://imgur.com/RugULg2)**

So listening to music and watching media is pretty identical here, each have their way of having a music widget [for any screen](http://imgur.com/vqGgOpM), [as well as on the lock screen](http://imgur.com/HZlQTJU). One thing I find annoying in iOS is how the platform handles gifs. They register as movies, and will pay in the iOS movie player, stopping whatever music I'm listening to despite the gif not having sound. I'm not sure why, but some gifs will also do this on Android. Overall, if you stare at Reddit for hours on end, or watch a ton of YouTube, your experience will practically be the same on both platforms.

**[Can't a guy get some privacy?!](http://imgur.com/c1mfdbn)**

Now despite what some governments might say, being for encryption does not mean you hate freedom. Privacy is a basic human right. As far as I can tell, all you need to do to encrypt your iPhone is set a lock screen. Easy. All you have to do is set up a lock screen password from settings and all your data is safe. This seems too simple to be true, but from working for a certain company that I may have signed an NDA with, Apple doesn't keep your pass code. If you call them because you forgot it, the only option is to factory reset the phone. Safe. For Android it's a bit more complicated. You can set a normal lock screen pin, but that won't encrypt the whole phone. To do that, you have to go through another security process that will then proceed to restart the phone and encrypt all off your data. Now I've never worked on the other side of this, so I can't say if Google keeps your codes (Disclaimer: The maker of your Android phone's hardware may also keep your data, encrypted or not, so be careful). If I had to choose though, I'd choose the company that will take the FBI to court to protect your data.

**[So where does that leave me?](http://imgur.com/OrhrhUw)**

Well the time came for my upgrade. I did a lot of thinking and looking, and decided to stick with what I knew. Android. As a YouTuber (I forget his name) once said, ""If you like Apple services, used Apple, if you like Google services, used Android"". So I suck with Android. I picked the phone I did because if it's hardware though, and I'm glad I did. Other than being massive and it running Verizon's LG's Google's soda flavor, it was well worth it.

To summarize, there are plenty of ups and downs on each platform, but when looking for a new phone, go with what hardware matters to you most. Besides, none of this really matters if you're [just going to be doing the same thing every day](http://imgur.com/NKO9hdT).",Android,232,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4f3pur/my_thoughts_on_why_it_might_not_really_matter/,neutral,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2020-06-29,1593455115,Discussion: Android Autofill is still messy and incomplete,"**tl;dr:** Autofill is so frustrating on my Android device, but is a breeze to use on my iPad. Google really needs to do more to improve autofill especially given the [revelations about clipboard data abuse with TikTok and many other apps](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/).

**Background:**

It's been nearly 3 years since the launch of Android Oreo, and if we account for beta, developers have had 3 years to get autofill to work properly. Moreover, Google has had time to make sure this feature works properly in Android.

**The Problem:**

What I've noticed is a lot of apps simply don't behave properly for auto fill, where either nothing fills or nothing ever pops up for an autofill prompt. Moreover, Chrome still doesn't seem to support Oreo autofill. Occasionally I do see a popup (maybe 1 in 20 tries) in Chrome, but it's pretty rare. Before everyone tells me to use accessibility autofill, I thought using Oreo's Autofill API is supposed to be a more secure method rather than relying on accessibility? So because of this, I still have to copy and paste from LastPass occasionally, which can get clunky.

This problem is compounded by the fact that many apps still don't support Face Unlock, which necessitates the bigger reliance on auto fill for me.

On the other side of the fence, iOS autofill has been working brilliantly. Not only does every app autofill properly, Safari also works fine. I have NEVER had to copy and paste any password manually in iOS.

**Pixel 4 experience:** [**https://i.imgur.com/fWpWqN6.mp4**](https://i.imgur.com/fWpWqN6.mp4)

Pardon having to resort to camera video. Using a screen recorder results in the PayPal screens being totally black (security?) so I had to resort to filming.

**iPad experience:** [**https://i.imgur.com/uZcsHG8.mp4**](https://i.imgur.com/uZcsHG8.mp4)

For whatever reason the iOS recording doesn't show the password autofilled (maybe security?), and neither does a screenshot, but a good old [photo](https://i.imgur.com/7nKgWeg.png) shows that it did autofill.

**Closing**

I really hope Google can improve on this autofill experience and at least make their browser behave more consistently. A lot of cooperation from app developers is needed, but this is a problem for EVERY new API.

2017-11-05,1509855491,"How can people turn to custom ROM (like LineageOS) for ""safety"" or ""privacy"" reasons if there are a bunch of compiled and blobs from unknown origin?","Something is bothering me from some time: I was planning to build myself a LineageOS rom to my phone and, when in need of extracting the proprietary blobs and compiled libraries, I would extract them from my original stock rom.

Fact is: when using the ""extract-files"" to extract the blobs and compiled libraries from my stock rom, it came to my surprise that only 200 of 1000 libraries were available to be extracted.

Trying to search about this issue, I realized that the repository https://github.com/TheMuppets is used to keep all the blobs needed for compiling. So far, so good.

But when you try to search for the historical record or origin of some libs/blobs, there's none (for example, for the Motorola G4 athene there's a super commit with a bunch of files in https://github.com/TheMuppets/proprietary_vendor_motorola/commit/3015bb44ccef05da07e63f5edc200e049d891058 with a comment ""add motorola g4"")! With all due respect, how can privacy advocates tell to use roms that we can't even track the blobs and compiled libs origin and be sure they aren't malicious? Isn't this a security risk as well?

**I'm not saying the developers are evil**. Maybe even them don't know the compiled libs they are getting from somewhere is malicious.

One is with Tasker, obviously, and another one that I know of is through Nova Launcher's gestures, which most of us use. 

You can assign one gesture (*pinch in* for me) to screen lock instantly, and then, under *Advanced Settings*, you can change the *Screen Lock Method* to *Device Admin* in order to fully lock the device [only] when you execute the gesture, requiring a password or a PIN to unlock, and directly bypassing biometrics. 

You need to enable Nova Launcher as a device admin in Phone Settings in order to see *Screen Lock Method* (thanks u/MintyPhoenix)

This is useful for me whenever I'm about to go through a security control at an airport, am interacting with law enforcement, or when I otherwise have to hand over my phone. Just a quick gesture and I'm done. As soon as you input your password, biometrics are restored.

In many countries, you can still deny revealing a password, while for most of the world biometric compliance is not up to you, and you can be forced to look at the phone or put your finger on the reader (plus, it is a lot harder for you to prove that you didn't do it willingly).

2024-02-03,1706956471,Beware! Major Security Flaw in Samsung Accounts,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to bring something to your attention that I recently discovered  a major security loophole in Samsung accounts that could leave you vulnerable if your phone gets stolen.

Imagine this scenario: you're out and about, using your unlocked phone, when suddenly someone snatches it and runs away. Or worse, someone secretly watches you enter your lock screen PIN and then takes off with your device. In either case, you're in trouble.

Here's how the situation escalates: the thief's first move is to access your phone's settings and head straight to the ""Samsung account"" panel  it's right there at the top. Then they would try to disable critical features like ""allow this phone to be found,"" ""send last location"" and ""offline finding"". But at this point, the phone prompts them to enter your Samsung password. No problem for them  they simply hit ""forgot password"" and proceed to enter your email or phone number, along with your first and last name and date of birth. All of this information is shockingly easy to find under the ""profile info"" section within the same ""Samsung account"" tab, without ever needing to ever know the phone PIN or needing your biometrics.

After entering the details, Samsung then sends a verification code via SMS or email  which conveniently arrives on the stolen phone itself  allowing the thief to reset your password and lock you out of your own device. And if all of this is too tough for them, there's another sneaky trick up their sleeve: the ""verify with one-time email"" option. Since many people use the same email address for their Samsung and Gmail accounts, the thief can simply send a one-time link and verify it through the email app, gaining full control of your Samsung account. Lastly, they would disable mobile data and wi-fi. Essentially this would render all your efforts to track or locate the phone useless and also lock you out of your account.

Why is this so concerning? Well, think about all the sensitive information we store on our phones  banking details, app passwords, personal notes. In Samsung Notes specifically, even if you've locked your notes, there's that ""reset password"" button, leading you straight into the same ""forgot password"" and ""one-time verification menu.""

In conclusion, this security flaw is a serious threat to our privacy and security. So let's spread the word and urge Samsung to address this issue promptly before more people fall victim to it.",Android,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ahtad1/beware_major_security_flaw_in_samsung_accounts/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2018-06-22,1529688404,FOLLOWUP: Andy OS (Andy Android Emulator),"## Recap
[My post, which you've probably seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulators/comments/8rj8g5/warning_andy_android_emulator_andyos_andyroid/) exposed Andy Emulator for installing a cryptocurrency miner on the host PC. After contacting them endlessly on their Facebook support page (which seemed to be the only active support forum for this software) I was met with a ban each time. The news about Andy spread super fast and articles were made about it on sites such as [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/andy-os-android-emulator-reportedly-installing-a-gpu-miner/), [Android Community](https://androidcommunity.com/psa-andy-os-android-emulator-will-install-a-bitcoin-miner-on-your-pc-20180618/), [BetaNews](https://betanews.com/2018/06/18/andy-os-bitcoin-miner/), [Tech Republic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/beware-this-android-emulator-its-hijacking-your-gpu-to-mine-cryptocurrency/) and countless more. It was safe to say that the owners of Andy could no longer avoid the issue. After seeing the backlash, the owner of the support Facebook group changes the privacy of it and prevented anyone from posting anything at all.

## Removal of miner
A few days after the press got ahold of what was going on, Andy completely replaced their installer. Why this installer wasn't served in the first place is beyond me. The new installer no longer calls the hidden 'GoogleUpdate.exe' (which installs the miner). Upon closing Andy, all processes relating to it close after a few seconds. It's great that they've removed the miner, but I still wouldn't trust this company with anything.

## Issues
**Contradiction**

As outlined in my previous post, two staff members at Andy gave different explanations as to why the miner was installed on the system, both of which can be proved wrong. A support member claimed that it was left over from a previous version of Andy that contained the 'Andy Cloud Experiment' which utilised blockchain technology (although I'm not sure why anything like this would require blockchain technology). This was then overruled by the Andy OS Inc. COO (or possibly their CTO), claiming that the installer was from a third party and that they'll look into it. Upon further inspection from /u/lawrenceabrams over at Bleeping Computer, he discovered that the executable named 'GoogleUpdate.exe' was what installed the miner and was actually signed by Andy OS Inc. In the most recent version, this executable is no longer present meaning it probably wasn't even needed in the first place. If it really was needed in the previous version, so much so that they had it officially signed... then why did it install a cryptocurrency miner? The miner installation was signed by Andy themselves, so they cannot deny that it was nothing to do with them.

**No apology/statement**

The majority of publications which reported on this issue asked Andy for comment to which they were met with no response (surprise surprise). In addition to this, as mentioned previously, their public support forum is no longer accepting new threads. Nobody over at Andy has bothered to publicly address this issue or to even attempt to try and clear their name (with the exception of some people in the support group who were extremely dismissive of the whole thing). To me it seems like they don't want to address it at all. It's being swept under the rug by them and I'm guessing once it's all blown over they'll open their Facebook group back up.


**Version numbers**

You would have expected, with this latest update, that they'd update the version number on their website. Nope. [The version number is exactly the same as what it was before, even down to the date.](https://i.imgur.com/vtr5ogV.png) I also noticed a fake star rating system which can't even be interacted with. By the looks of things, they've given *themselves* 4.5/5 stars. Where is that information sourced from?

## Conclusion
In the past, Andy has had some shady things going on and with this most recent issue, even more so. Personally, I don't think I'd want to download anything that comes out of that company ever again. A massive breach of trust has been handed to their userbase.

Andy, give us answers. Tell us what happened and why it happened. Why was the miner installation file signed by your company if the installer was from a third party?

2017-01-18,1484766995,Have you ever considered buying a phone based on its Custom ROM support?,"WARNING: Sort of long post incoming

I've had a conflicted history with Android, not because of the system but because my country is not very secure and I got my used S2 and G3 stolen within a month of purchasing. But during that time I learned about custom ROMs, modding your phone and making it look how you like it to be, and that feeling was unachievable with Nokia, BlackBerry or iPhones which I used as replacements throughout the time.

The phone I used for the longest time was my Moto G first generation, an amazing and durable phone who had an incredible amount of support from the community, but I caved in for a G3, the one that got stolen and I had to go back to a really old Nokia Windows environment.

I finally made enough money to buy my first ever new phone, the Asus Zenfone 2 Laser (ZOOT). I was so excited about having a really good mid-range phone, but I was really dissapointed with ZenUI's bloatware and the lack of updates. That's when I met the best developers I've met for Custom ROM's, two guys working on making Cyanogenmod available and tending to each and every one of the bugs through XDA, or IRC if anything was needed more personally. The experience with my phone was amazing now, more stable, battery life same as stock and camera quality was the same due to the fact they made the Asus PixelMaster app being compatible with us.

Updates were very fast and as I saw posts in this sub of people wating for Marshmallow or Nougat, I already had it and it was working stable with all the features it came with. That's when it hit me, I will consider my purchases from now on based on it's Custom ROM support, they will give the phone new life and make it live for much longer than Asus would intended it's life span to be.

Have any of you guys ever thought about it or have done it? I just want to discuss this because it's just incredible what these guys do for us on their spare time, they make something I use a lot a very nice thing to have, not something I'm annoyed with.

Edit: I am very happy to hear that lots of people take this into account.

**I know this breaks a few rules but I feel like this is too important not to break them.**

*************

## What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

## What's the plan?

On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*.

## What can you do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/)\- and sign your username in support to this post.

3. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side.

2015-10-10,1444459231,TIL Sony uses a custom firmware for review units.,"While looking at repair documents for the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact, I noticed that there is a process called ""customization"" to alter the software of a handset using Sony's flashtool, called Emma.  There is also [a list of customizations](http://sony.yt/topic/7549-list-of-firmware-customization-for-%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D0%BAa%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-spis-customizacji-firmware-dla-sony-xperia-z3-compact-d5803/) for the D5803 (US/EU version).  One of the customizations is ""1288-9655 D5803/Mobile Phone/US charger/Commercial and Journalists (Internal)/White"".  I don't see any more details about any firmwares, but I wonder what Sony changed for review handsets.  Could they have done something innocuous, like not bundle bloatware because carriers will differ, or could it be more malicious, like making throttling less aggressive to raise benchmark scores?  

Edit: Another, possibly less scandalous finding is that the Z2 and Z3 series are build on the same platform (Shinano) and share a notable amount of source code.  This also partially explains why the Z1 series will not be updated to Marshmallow; it is on a different board called Rhine, and would take a lot more effort to update another generation of phones.  https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/device-sony-shinano

Edit 2: Thanks for the many commenters that contributed.  The consensus is that there is no cheating going on, and the firmware usually restricts benchmarks and posts to website like XDA.

2020-07-17,1594964650,Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Display Issue - The scam that Samsung doesn't want to admit,"I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green/yellowish green. 

Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like ""Reset your device"". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.

This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.

Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a ""premium"" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a ""premium phone"", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. 

And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.

2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- ""We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new"" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.

More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

2024-10-20,1729426535,Are Manufacturers Restricting Custom ROMs &amp; Bootloader Unlocking on Android Devices?,"Hey Android community,

I've noticed a concerning trend with some Android manufacturers starting to restrict bootloader unlocking, which limits users' ability to install custom ROMs. Recently, Ive seen Realme disable bootloader unlocking on certain devices, which seems like a step backward for Androids ethos of being open and customizable.

This raises a broader question: Are we seeing the beginning of the end for true Android freedom? As enthusiasts, we've long appreciated Android's flexibility in letting users take control of their deviceswhether its through custom ROMs like PixelOS  LineageOS, rooting, or simply tweaking the OS.

What are your thoughts on this trend? Should the Android community be more vocal about manufacturers locking down devices? Is this something we should be concerned about for the future of Android?

2024-06-10,1718053428,What does Android offer now that iOS still doesn't?,"For as long as they've existed, Androids seemed like the more mature system that allows more user customization, granular control over the OS, automation, developer friendly APIs, and overall more flexibility when it comes to alternatives app stores. 

Since then, Google has iteratively locked Android down more and more, by taking away existing features or by promoting the manager that made a feature and letting it get killed the next cycle. 

Apple (whether of their own volition or under pressure) has gone the other way, slowly but surely opening up iOS to more user customization, alternative app stores, allowing RCS, third-party keyboards, and adding genuinely useful things like lock screen widgets, . Developers are overwhelmingly more focused on their iOS apps and bring features there first with Android apps always getting features later. 

Things that were unique to Android like automations are now present (in a lesser degree) in iOS as shortcuts. Developers are all more willing to integrate Apple's new APIs in integration things like Live Activities and Dynamic Island support, while half the Android apps I use still aren't sure whether the navigation bar needs a transparent background or not. 

The only places where I feel Android still fares better is with notification management, and the community's ability to circumvent corporate greed (things like ReVanced, Instander, 3rd party Reddit apps). What areas do you feel Android does better than iOS now?

Edit: it's a bit surprising that a lot of people's notion of what iOS is like today resembles what it used to be like 5 years ago.

[Let's refresh ourselves on what Android 11 can do.](https://imgur.com/a/AuPYlcM)

* Choose from 7 Fonts.
* Choose from 7 quick setting icon styles.
* Choose from 14 colours.
* Choose from 7 App shapes.
* Choose the Grid size.
* You can then save all those as a profile, so you can easily switch between profiles.

[Now let's look at Android 12 with Material You.](https://imgur.com/a/OdfKzVg)

* You can either have an AI generate colours based on your wallpaper, or select from 4 basic colours.
* You can toggle on ""Themed Icons"", which is just a single alternative style only for Google's own apps.
* The grid size option is still there.

That's it.

This is objectively worse for customization.

2017-12-21,1513840040,PSA: Gearbest customer details including passwords are available unprotected and online. The have known about it for at least 6 days and done nothing.,"Hi guys, [I'm cross-posting this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/7l2y9w/gearbest_customer_details_including_passwords/) from /r/Xiaomi where a few users there have been affected. As they are a reasonably popular retailer amongst the Android community I'm trying to raise awareness as Gearbest have shown a complete lack of willingness to do anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Original post: 
&gt; 
&gt; Every now and then I like to Google my email address as some sort of random security check. I got an unusual hit on Friday, a Pastebin paste with my email address, password and order information for an order I placed with Gearbest amongst hundreds of other customers.
&gt; 
&gt; I immediately contacted them through Customer Support and Facebook. Their Customer Support didn't answer until the next day, clearly not understanding the request, despite me including a screenshot of the online leak. I replied with a link and they didn't respond until a day later saying that they ""take matters of security very seriously"" they ""will investigate"" and ever so generously donated $10 credit to my account.
&gt; 
&gt; So obviously, I think that they're going to send out an email to all of their customers, letting them know their information has been compromised ASAP. Well, no. They've done nothing. The information is still online and if you log in using this information you will find the home address of the user as well as a password which is very likely reused on other websites.
&gt; 
&gt; This is perhaps the most careless approach to online security I have ever experienced and as Gearbest is popular worldwide, it's important that all customers know ASAP.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Here is my exchange with their representative.](https://imgur.com/a/dp1mU)

2020-03-25,1585094656,"Can I complain about NFC, and their apparent ignoring of the competing substandards?","As a pretext here, most of you will not care, or ever experience the problems I am about to talk about. Most of these revolves are niche use-cases, international travel and interoperability, and the problems with standards, substandards, and manufacturers just not being transparent about their devices. It has no real effect on most people's use of their device, and most people would be better off not paying attention to it. It's just a gripe of mine, because it shouldn't be a problem, in my opinion, at all. It's a seriously annoying thing to have to dig through in order to find out, ""nope, it's just a feature we advertised support for, but really we only support X variant of"".

***

Anyways, onto the rant.

***

I'm going to start this off by breaking a myth most people believe, without knowing it's a myth or that they even believe it. NFC is not a standard, but a set of standards. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication#/media/File:NFC_Protocol_Stack.png) a lovely diagram demonstrating the clusterfuck that is NFC. If you don't understand the diagram that well, it's okay. I don't think the NFC forum does either because technically, a Type 3 tag is partially readable by an NFC A/B device; but cannot be transmitted and various other bullshit because fuck you. The gist is basically this;

Not only are the 5 competing tag types, 1-4 plus the NFC forum formatted tag.

There are also, 8-9 competing protocols (plus an additional application protocol that is competing with 2-3 other protocols that are overarching, but 3 protocols don't even use an application protocol.

And, ***AT LEAST*** six competing product standards, one which is not mutually compatible with the rest.

Yet in spite of this massive clusterfuck, the NFC, GSMArena, device makers, basically no one, makes any attempt to specify which protocols, tag types, whatever, these phones use or support. This madness for me, all started when I first started transitioning into trying to use Google Pay for all of my loyalty and charge cards. In the process of this I tried to figure out how to add my SUICA card from Japan to it, since I know you can do this...but it just wouldn't work. Why? Well, because my phone doesn't support NFC-F or the FeLiCa variant of the protocol. It probably doesn't support tag 3 entirely either. So then how would I have known? Well, FeLiCa for phones is branded as JÂµÂ¤Ã•Â±Ã¼Â¿Â¤(Osaifu-Keitai) or Wallet-cellphone. Unfortunately, these phones are almost exclusively sold in Japan.

However, I figured, since FeLiCa was part of the NFC standard set, my NFC-supporting phone would support it...right? No. Because, as I said before, it is a set of standards. Not all standards are necessarily universal, and FeLiCa/NFC-F is almost exclusive to Japan. But now I have a dilemma. How do I know which specific NFC standards my device supports? Well, I simply don't know, because it's clear that no one actually cares. What's even more confusing is that, using specialized apps my phone can read the transaction history on the SUICA card, even though it can't work with NFC-F apparently? Why? I have no fucking clue.

So I think that gets everything off my chest. Being locked up due to this virus probably hasn't helped me festering over this. Oh, and a fun ending fact. Apple's iPhones and the Google Pixel series universally support NFC-F, including Osaifu-Keitai. So, I guess my choices are getting more and more limited as I want an actually useful international phone. I either buy Apple or Google in country, or import a phone from Japan. ffs

2013-06-04,1370316064,Uncommon knowledge about Android and it's menu button,"I've said this before and I'll say it again: the concept of a menu button needs to die. It was ingrained in Android Users as a common way to navigate apps since the beginning, but as of Android 3.0, Google designed out the menu button and replaced it with the Action Bar. This design carried over into ICS and still exists today, over two years later.

I hope Google decides to completely deprecate the hardware menu key in the next version of Android. The current behaviour is very confusing to the end user, even if Google claims its consistent for customers with brand loyalty (aka, Samsung fans). On the Galaxy S and S2, the menu key was a necessity. Android 2.3 and below required a menu key to function properly. But now, that's not the case.

The now two-year-old Action Bar is very nice for developers and users because it took the hidden menu and put it on the screen where everyone can see it while adding consistency to app design throughout the entire OS. It makes apps more intuitive because you no longer have to guess to figure out how to navigate around an app. In the past everyone had to hit the menu button on every single screen just to see if there were options available. With the Action Bar that disappeared as everything is placed on the screen where the user can see it. When an app has a decent sized list of Action Bar items - more than 2 or 3 - the Action Overflow button (the nice 3-dot button everyone should be familiar with by now) is displayed by the system and all of the items that couldnt fit in the space are put into a nice drop down list. Developers even have the ability to force items into the Action Overflow even if there's room for the buttons on the screen. However, on devices that have a physical menu button (like every single Samsung device), this Action Overflow button never appears. The overflow items are hidden behind the physical menu button and the device behaves exactly the same way as Android's old menu. Why is this bad? BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE MORE ACTION BAR ITEMS THAN WHAT IS ON THE SCREEN! These Acton items are no longer easily discoverable like they should be and users are required to hit the menu button on every screen they see.


As soon as I realized this horrible functionality put in place by Google, I looked up how to force the app I'm currently writing to display the Overflow button even if a device has a menu button. Id rather that my app is as intuitive as possible, than my app conform to the way the device handles navigation. So, I found the solution I was searching for, I implemented it, and Ive been anti-menu button ever since. The app Im writing now shows the Action Overflow button on my Galaxy S3 and when I hit the physical menu button it expands the overflow menu just as if Id hit the overflow button itself. Most of the time I find myself hitting the overflow button instead anyways because it just makes more sense and it's more intuitive. Ive even gone to the extent of forcing the overflow button throughout my entire device thanks to this nifty custom rom Im running.

Here is what I think Google should do in the next version of Android: always show the overflow button on the screen if it should be there and completely ignore a hardware menu button if it exists. There hasnt been a need for a menu button since Android 4.0 (for phones) and its been almost TWO YEARS for manufacturers to get their stuff together.

For all of you out there that like having a menu button, get with the program. It took me designing and writing my own app to even know about this issue and I just wanted to share it with all of you non-developer android enthusiasts that haven't been made aware.

tl;dr: Goodbye physical menu button, hello Action Bar and Acton Overflow.

Note: I actually wrote most of this a couple months ago as part of a larger article, but I never submitted it anywhere.

TLDR If you've tried transferring multiple times and have already linked your Google account with all your data backed up/synced, skip it and choose the bottom option to start fresh. It should have all the contacts/messages etc already transferred.

I gave the transfer a good effort but each attempt was cancelled several times, some after 30min and some after plenty of hours. I was beyond PO'd and just skipped the android to iphone transfer, CONTINUING (not restarting) the fresh start option with the intent to just add contacts and whatnot since this was all to help my mom move from android knowing iPhone would suit her best. When everything was booted up it asked if I wanted to install previous apps. I said sure and saw that pretty much everything I needed was transferred for her.

Initially I had her go through the startup with me, logging into her Google account, setting up touch id, etc. When going through different solutions for the data transfer I tried BOTH the most recent Move to iOS app and the older apk version of Move to iOS; turned off mobile data and erased each wifi network to prevent preferred auto connection; even set up a Switchbot to tap the iPhone screen every 30sec to keep it from sleeping (because that helped some folks since most fails are due to the phone sleeping for too long) but still it always cancelled. I don't know if getting as far as possible with the data transfer had anything to do with the success, which I'd keep in mind if there's still any trouble when getting through the setup (utilizing any tips to make the transfer run as far as possible).

So if you're having trouble and didn't think to use Google, have everything synced through an account and the whole process might end up being pretty quick for the essentials.",ios,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1gmhgcf/successfully_moved_to_ios_from_android_motorola/,irrelevant,Stance: pro_ios,,,,,,,,

Some things with IOS is this lagging way behind in terms of usability in the UI. Hope some day Apple addresses these minor things as the phones are getting bigger but our hands are not :) 

&amp;#x200B;

T9-search in the Dialer is the first thing i tried when i got hold on my new mini12. Realized that i had to first to go contacts, hit the name bar, type the name and choose from and option what to do with the contact. in this case make a phone call. Stupid thing is that i have to move my thumb so much for so simple task that a T9-dialer could do.

Notification bar. Swiping down just brings the Search-option. Why cant i have an option what does the gesture do instead of stuck with this option what i personally do not need. 

Battery %. this is implemented in evey gadget in the world but not in IOS. I have to have a widget to do show that. Waste of screen space.

But my reason to swich to the IOS was simple. Device support for many years what Apple is great at. And also that i love the size of my 12mini because it fits in my hand and pockets easily.  Hope Apple makes IOS more gesture friendly by default so i dont have to jailbreak this thing because of these simple things that could be easily implemented in the coming IOS17.

Its simply amazing that iOS 18 is now a step up than stock Android in terms of overall customisation, but Notification centre is the worst","I have been using iphones on and off over the last couple of years as part of some work testing related so have an idea of the evolution of ios . I switched because i think IOS 18 is awesome in terms of the customisation which i have always wanted, combined with the animations and Apple's polish ( like the wallpaper clock depth) i am enjoying the iphone 16 pro so far. Getting used to the camera control button, its also great that the camera app offers so much controls ( undertones, depth, exposure ) , while the pixel camera doesnt even have a pro mode. Btry is amazing ! Face ID is magic and so convenient that we can use it to lock / hide apps in a simple manner while in android currently we have to jump through hoops in secure folder / some other thing.

Keyboard definitely needs getting used to coming from android where for symbols we can just long press, dedicated punctuation keys ( period and comma ). I know we can use gboard but its not well integrated and feels clunky in iOS.

The worst part of experience so far is the notification centre

* For some apps i want the notifications to stay on the main notification screen and not go into the notification centre
* Its just a useless extra step to unlock phone, then do another swipe to go to notification centre

2021-09-26,1632698016,"""Move to iOS"" app stuck eternally on ""preparing"" on the Android phone. I've googled extensively to try to find a fix for this and I can't get past it.","Update: This post gets a lot of attention awhile after its posting. I was not able to get the app to work and just abandoned my text messages. You may try some of the suggestions below, but I don't recommend commenting here or reaching out to me individually as this post is old and I'm not on reddit very much anymore. Good luck!

Again, the app DID NOT work for me so I cannot offer any advice. Please DO NOT comment on this post or direct comments to me as I cannot help you. 

Hi all,

Switching from an Android A20 to an iPhone 13. All I want to do is move my SMS messages from my old phone to the iPhone - the rest I can live without or move manually. The Move to iOS app seems to be the only way to do this (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

I had a hell of a time even getting the Move to iOS app to connect consistently and not drop the connection on my Android, but I've got it now to where it will hold the connection (gonna leave a comment with how I did that below because what's out there on the internet is not what I had to do).

The problem now is that I can get to the screen where my android says ""preparing"" and my iPhone says ""waiting"". It then gets stuck like this forever - and I mean forever, I left it overnight for about 10 hours last night and it did not move past this screen.

My android is able to connect to the iPhone-created wifi network, although it does say it lacks internet connection but from what I understand this is normal. Both phones are plugged in. Common advice is to use airplane mode but that's outdated as the Move to iOS app will not let you proceed on the android phone with airplane mode on, even if you turn wifi back on and manually connect to the wifi network. The phones are in close proximity to each other. ""Smart switch"" wifi is commonly recommended to turn off by my phone doesn't seem to have that option. I've turned off any ""automatically connect to"" settings in my wifi settings and deleted all other known networks. All I'm trying to move is about 2G of SMS messages.

Anyone have any ideas of things to try? I'm really bummed about not being able to have my SMS messages on my phone - if I have to I'll back them up some other way but it's not the same as having the conversations be continuous. If anyone knows of another service that will do this please let me know too.

Haven't done much of that the last few gens because I'm lazy, but the point is that digging around in the software of things isn't foreign to me. 

My parents just got new internet, and a new router at home. (25mbps to 300mbps for the win), and their phones are being absurd with the new internet.

They require wifi calling, because their signal where they are is poor, and zero in the house.  Wifi calling on these phones (both newer generation devices with updated software) is like trying to teach a cat to fly mach 3.  It'll work fine, then for no reason at all, it won't work.  Nothing changed.  Both phones at the same time.  Restarting all devices from phone, router, modem, everything.... no avail.  

I can walk in with my S24 and it grabs wifi and wifi calling immediately.  Zero issues. 

edit: ALL devices are T-Mobile.

Again, no settings have been changed since it was set up.  It works when it wants to.  WHAT is happening here?  Does anyone have any back end knowledge of what iOS is doing here? 

Googling dozens of pages just gives me moron guides on how to turn on and off settings, set up wifi calling, and so forth.   I don't need level 1 troubleshooting...

6. Is there an easy way to connect via VPN to your home network and use ssh to manage your stuff?
7. Can you set up reminders on the default iOS calendar app? I mean no dummy appointments or stuff, just straight up reminders
8. Is there a good file explorer or does iOS regulate that stuff entirely? For example: can I use a file explorer to export files on an iPhone to my Nas?

2024-11-05,1730778300,Moving to iOS from an Android,"Hi,

I've decided that this Black Friday, I'll switch from Android to iOS, moving from an old Huawei to the iPhone 15. My issue is that once I buy the new phone, how can I transfer all my apps to it? Is there an easy and quick method? All my apps on the Huawei have 2FA on that device, including Google Authenticator, Okta Verify, as well as my social media accounts (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook)not to mention my photos and videos. It feels like this could take me days! Surely, the goal is to have the iPhone set as ""default device"" for each app for future 2FA verifications

2024-09-12,1726160092,[iOS vs Android] My personal experience,"Recently, an Android user came here to express how much he thinks iOS is inferior to Android. I feel compelled to share my experience as a longtime user who is a fan of both. I am currently using an iPhone 15 Pro Max as my main phone and Oppo Reno 4 Pro as a secondary device for torrenting and other entertainment purposes.

Back in early 2022, I handed down my Oppo Reno 4 Pro to my father. This near-high-end Android phone from 2020, equipped with a Super AMOLED display, superfast charging, four rear cameras, and 8GB RAM, had served me well for nearly two years. Recently, my father complained about its significantly reduced battery life. He was considering either replacing the battery or purchasing a good power bank. Instead, I decided to upgrade his device entirely. I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy A55 for him and transferred all his data and apps from the old Oppo. Since he no longer needed the old phone, I reclaimed it for personal use, hoping to rediscover the beautiful memories I had associated with it. After reclaiming the phone, I replaced the battery for it. Despite my long-standing preference for Android, I now find the platform inconvenient and limiting, almost feeling like a jail compared to iOS.

**Shortcuts:** Im an avid shortcut creator with over 200 shortcuts Ive made and nearly 1,000 in my library. I recently published 49 shortcuts on RoutineHub. Ive found the Share Sheet on Android to be extremely limitedit only includes apps and some modded apps (such as TubeMate) I downloaded but lacks any personal shortcuts I created to meet my specific needs, as well as the numerous other shortcuts made by other users. Many of these shortcuts are one-tap AI shortcuts developed by my Vietnamese friends, which can perform many fun tasks such as: AI image outpainting shortcut, AI image upscaler shortcut, and trying on online clothes on your own photo using AI.

**Automation:** Android lacks the extensive automation capabilities available on iOS. I cannot perform the 25 different complicated automations (that use complicated shortcuts) that I regularly use on iOS. Sure, Tasker has many automation options, but its UI is ugly and it lacks easy-to-understand intuitive actions, relying instead on technical variables and numbers, making it extremely hard to use. Shortcuts are simply a lot more advanced than Tasker, with many actions capable of doing things Tasker cannot.

**Drag and Drop:** Many UI parts and elements within the Android system and its apps dont support drag and drop, nor do they allow for selecting multiple items to drag and drop simultaneously. This feature is ubiquitous in iOS and supports dragging and dropping multiple apps/items at once. I can drag, hold the items, and navigate to a different location in the Files app (or other file manager apps) and drop them where I want. At best, in the most advanced Android apps, drag and drop can handle one item and only on one page (you cannot hold the item while navigating between different pages, meaning you cannot use 2-3 fingers at the same time).

**Photo management (sorting, searching, etc):** In iOS, a photo/video can be added into many albums. In Android, each photo/video can only be sorted into one folder. Although some apps refer to folders as albums, they are technically still folders. If you want to sort a photo/video into multiple folders, you have to copy and paste it multiple times, which consumes storage space (unlike in iOS, where copying files doesnt use additional storage; it just tags the file in additional places). I know Google Photos has the album feature, but the problem is Google Photos forces me to back up the photo/video, which decreases my available free cloud storage if I want to sort that photo/video into one or multiple albums. In iOS, you can sort a photo/video into one or multiple albums without having to upload/sync them into iCloud, just completely offline. To search for images or videos based on the text inside them or the subject matter they contain, you also need to upload all your images and videos to Google Photos. Uploading photos is fine because they are lighter, but videos are a different story; a 4K video can be up to 5GB. Video storage costs a lot.

**Transferring Files:** Transferring files on Android can be problematic, especially because Android doesnt support transferring files with long filenames. This is a significant drawback when transferring movies downloaded from the internet, which often have long names that include details like version, year, video resolution, sound quality, and the provider of the torrent. I often find myself having to bulk rename video files and subtitles. In contrast, on iOS, I can simply drag and drop movie folders without issue. This long filename issue is well-documented and affects many users:
- [Eleven Forum Discussion on Long Filenames](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/copy-long-file-names-in-long-paths-get-canceled-without-any-error.18226/)
- [Super User Discussion on Filename Limitations](https://superuser.com/questions/1682382/are-there-filename-limitations-when-transferring-files-to-an-android-device-usin)
- [Reddit Discussion on File Copy Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/18depu6/fyi_you_cant_copy_files_with_long_names_via_usb/)

**Universal Undo and Redo:** On iOS, undo and redo features are available system-wide by default, whereas on Android, only some apps support these functions.

**Browser Limitations:** Chrome on Android lacks support for extensions, which significantly reduces its functionality compared to Safari on iOS, which supports a multitude of useful extensions, including ad-blockers that can be toggled directly from the browser.

**Haptic Feedback:** The haptic feedback when typing on Android feels awkward and less refined compared to iOS, detracting from the overall user experience.

**Custom Back Tap Shortcuts:**
- **Two Back Taps:** On iOS, I use a custom shortcut to toggle the screen rotation lock with just two back taps. This action also triggers vibration feedback to indicate whether the lock has been enabled or disabled (one vibration indicates disable, two vibrations indicate enable).
- **Three Back Taps:** Another custom shortcut involves using three back taps to display a temporary screenshot that allows me to copy or translate text immediately. This process does not consume additional storage, as the screenshot is not permanently saved.

And so many more, I can write a whole book about this.

While Android does offer apps like YouTube ReVanced Extended, AeroInstagram, MiXplorer,  Tasker, cracked premium AdGuard, TubeMate and various interesting modded apps, these arent sufficient to offset the limitations Ive encountered.

Heres my RoutineHub profile, which has some of the iOS shortcuts Ive created:

Google maps on Android is light years ahead in usability and its totally strange to me as to why that is. Its not dependant on smartphone competition since Google is only interested in people using their services so it should not be crippling its application intentionally on iOS. The iOS version sticks stubbornly on the chosen timeline of your directions and is not considering your position at all, it will suggest to get off a bus that youre not on only because it reached the time of your timeline to do so, Android is not doing that. It will suggest you walk to the next bus stop, although you are already on one with the same bus lines, and even though its on the same street just a few meters down the road, it will suggest a weird path like a small circle for no apparent reason, and again Android does not do that. It will show a 10 minute walk as 28 minute walk although it is still 10 minutes on the timeline, etc. Im really disappointed in the switch between platforms since I use Google maps for public transport all the time and Apple maps does not have public transport options in my country.

2021-02-07,1612683980,Consider switching to iOS from Android,"Hi there,

I'm using Android since it exists, and after many years of hope for better OS upgrade support, and better privacy control, nothing has progressed heavily.

I even gave up Samsung models to go to Pixel lines from Google, it's better, but nothing near the Apple ecosystem.

I'm considering to buy and iPhone 11, as it has a nice price cut in France versus the 12.

But I have not used LCD screen on mobile device since the Galaxy S2, so I'm a bit afraid of this rollback, even if LCD pannels from Apple are known to be top tier.

I'm also a bit worried by the fact that I don't want to use the whole Apple ecosystem: I'm fine with my Linux setup, as it's a part of my job. I know that the most beautiful thing in iOS is the heavy continuity with others Apple products, and I'm a bit afraid of not enjoy the whole thing and miss the point. Eventually I will switch to macOS later, but it's more difficult than to switch from smartphone manufacturer ; as I have no particular love for Android or Google, but I do have for my Linux ecosystem.

The last point is the price. I switched from flagship to medium range on Android. A model like the Pixel 4a at 349Â¬ fulfills my need. I'm not attracted at all be the iPhone SE, screen is too small and the heavy black borders is old memories. iPhone 11 or 12 are great. But it  reach the 1000Â¬ tagline if I opt for Apple Care+, which is a must for a pricetag like this I think. Is Care+ really great? In Europe we have already a 2 year maintenance for tech products instead of the default 1 year in USA, but I want the ""any risks"" coverage of Care+, even if I saw that changing the screen or other parts needs and additional payment...

TL;DR : I'm bored with the stagnation of Android. The only main advantage relayed for Android vs. iOS is the customization now, and I don't customize my phone OS a lot. But I'm a bit afraid of the ""new toy effect"" that keeps attract me to look at Apple in this period.

2020-02-09,1581265785,Yes another iOS vs android post,"
Lets see... both operating systems have their perks, and as long as you are not an idiot you can do most of the same things without issue.

However, for the casual user, android is much more dangerous. Malware and spyware frequent the google play store. Emails, messages, and ads online can link you to a too good to be true download page for an app that will improve your phone or whatever. Then proceed to send everything you have to china. As long as you have some technical knowledge and can spot the signs of a fake app or service, you should be fine. On ios, you dont need this skill due to the nature of sand boxing and the fact that the App Store is so heavily curated. That is point number one.

Two, their may be more apps on android, many of which promote theft of intellectual property and are easily ripped into third party stores to be hacked into an ad free experience, thus robbing what little revenue android devs can enjoy, vs ios where devs are able to make powerful apps and charge money and actually live from that income. Apps on ios are generally more polished due to the fact that most phones are running similar hardware and the most current OS. Devs can target the last two years of features and capture almost 100% of the ios user base. iOS only apps tend to be more fluid, use less resources, and have more similar UI paradigms across apps.

Three, the phone you buy today will be updated to use the latest security paradigms and new features as permitted by hardware for the next 5-6 years. Android may give out some app and security updates separate from its OS, but this still leaves large gaping holes in the baseline OS that are only solved by full system updates. Remember stage fright? Still affects most of the android user base simply because they cannot update. You are locked in or maybe given one new OS through the life of an android phone and that sucks.

Four, iPhones degrade at a much slower rate. Something about android, its inefficiencies, and its RAM management just murder phones. Sure someone will comment their 2014 samsung something or other still works today. Likely because you can easily swap batteries in the older phones. But it is less common for an android device to last more than 2 years without straight up debilitating degradation and software slowdown. This is my experience and experience of people around me, if you have evidence to the contrary then good for you.

Five, and most importantly. Data collection. Using google services on android will lead to 10X more data collection per hour than when using google on ios. This data is used to track your everyday activities, who you talk to, where you go, what you buy, etc, all to show you an ad for a toothpaste you dont want. On ios you can change settings top to bottom to basically hide yourself from the prying eye of advertisers and such. Android, no matter what you do unless you root your device, you will be seen by google and the apps you use.

So ill name some positives of android. The android notification triage and sorting is better. Having widgets on the home screen is somewhat nice, if distracting. Emulation is alive and well on android, and ios it is becoming impossible. Android also allows for more custom settings, like default apps and skinning the general OS. That being said, those cosmetic advantages will never make me want android. There is nothing on android that would make me want to switch. iOS, with its security, siri shortcuts, photography tools, and ecosystem would be hard to leave.",ios,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/f1ay5y/yes_another_ios_vs_android_post/,neutral,Stance: pro_ios,,,,,,,,

2021-12-21,1640127503,"iOS needs a back button or a consistent gesture that just works all the time, on every app.","This one is a second-hand opinion coming from a friend who likes Android, please do not reject this post as an Android vs iOS rant. Ive been an avid iOS user for a long time but I see his point this time for a change :)

I really hope this doesnt get downvoted to the bottom of the stack.

I wanted to share this here to get some honest opinions on this one. Like many here for me personally this has never been an issue  I think its because Ive just gotten used to the left-to-right swipe gesture or &amp;lt; button up there but I seldom struggle to get the back gesture right though

Yes, I already know about the left-to-right swipe gesture on iOS, but if you take a step back for a moment you will realise that this gesture is not consistently implemented/imposed by iOS across all apps. For instance, on the Google Photos app like my friend says, when youre viewing photos, the left-to-right swipe obviously shows the previous pic and doesnt take you back to the photo grid  you see that gesture doesnt have a consistent meaning as it takes the most implied action for the app page/screen. Lets ignore those apps where the developer is at fault anyway. 

It seems like it cant be enforced everywhere as a left-to-right swipe gesture has varied implied meaning in different aspects of the OS or an app as seen from the example above, thats why Apple has this &amp;lt; button to cater for this  the point is, why cant this &amp;lt; be the default and left-to-right swipe be the optional back gesture (of course, which works most of the time but not always, as long as it a secondary thing no one will/should really complain IMO) + this gesture has no visual acknowledgement (UI element or haptics) like in Pixel. 

Furthermore, as the screens go big, reaching out for that &amp;lt; button on the top left in the app is a bit of a pain even for big hands. 

As my friend says, you expect iOS to be very slick but then it disappoints on occasions such as this, I know its not a major thing but then Apple is known for such small magical things in software and hardware experience.

I wish Apple rethinks the whole iOS UI/UX for better management of big screens (e.g., putting the &amp;lt; on the bottom left would be a good start, but then it may get into the whole look they copied the Android discussion that Apple marketing wants to avoid)

P.S. I am not a UI/UX expert, although have been a graphic designer in the past, so I think I know what I am talking about here. I would love to listen to the experts here.

2024-12-30,1735536296,"Would iOS fit my nitpicky, news-focused needs?","Sorry for the length of this. I have looked through quite a few Android vs iOS posts and none seem to really tackle my use cases.

I am approaching my next phone upgrade and wanted to weigh my options carefully. I have only ever used Android phones (save for a very brief period with a Gen 1 iPad.) At this time I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra, which I like well enough, and am debating the iPhone 16 Pro/Max vs the S24/25 Ultra.

Generally, I'm not in the Mac ecosystem. I have a 2014 Macbook Pro somewhere and use an iPod Classic in my car, but otherwise use a Windows PC, laptop and a Galaxy Tab 7 tablet. I am slightly uncomfortable with how little I know about iOS because it leaves me clueless if older folks around are having a phone issues and ask me for help.

There are basically two specific programs I am interested in on iOS: FinalDraft Go, since I use FinalDraft on Desktop, and Apple News, since I am a prolific consumer of news and politics. 

I am also generally irritated with Samsung's updates lately, since I have been at risk of losing access to my work programs when they neglected to push updates until right when my office's security policies were getting pissed.

I have apprehension about changing ecosystems to chase two apps, though, so I wanted to sort of check to see if my other usages transfer well to iOS. 

(1) I specifically am interested in Apple News because it allows access to a lot of different sources for cheap. I am a politics blogger, and need to be able to cite and quote sources. Does this program allow for easy copying and pasting of the source text for this? (I frequently will stick large blocks of text into an email body to reference later.) Does it have any kind of ""share link"" feature or other way for me to grab the original URLs in case I need to link them?

What I don't want is an environment so closed that I would read an article from say, Time, in an app, and then have to later get on the desktop to find the article on Time's website, too, in order to properly cite or reference it.

(2) I do a lot of reading/writing on the Substack app and mobile web -- does it perform as well on iOS as Android?

(3) For Reddit, I use(d) RIF and currently Redreader -- I can't stand the New Reddit design and will die stuck on old.reddit. Are there equivalent third party apps.

(4) How is Outlook on iOS? I make use of it heavily for work. 

(5) I am a heavy Facebook user and will frequently have to scroll very, very far into groups, pages, search results and member lists. Does Facebook for iOS perform as well as it does on Android?

(6) The only real game I play is Marvel Snap -- does it run well enough on iOS?

(7) Most of my media is just Chromecasted at home, usually to a NVIDIA Shield. Does iOS play well with thise devices?

(8) How does the device's reception compare compared to a Galaxy device? I spend some time in low reception or congested environments (office buildings, large crowds in hotel basements, events on the National Mall) and every Android phone I've had really starts to drag and drain battery when it has to fight for signal.

(9) When driving, I tend to connect my phone to two Bluetooth devices, a headset for calls and a Bluetooth to Aux adapter to get Google Maps directions/YouTube/Audible/Podcasts etc. going. Android pretty seamlessly, without any more input than me answering a call, pauses the podcast while still playing directions when I take a call. Is there similar functionality to this on iPhone? 

I don't care about the camera at all, and actively try to avoid AI integration or smart assistant stuff.

Thanks for any help or insight -- I know this is a lot, and it's totally possible the final answer is that iOS isn't for me.

2024-06-19,1718808421,A-GPS on iOS,"There's simply not enough info on how Apple's A-GPS works. Let me provide some info on gps (iOS 16.7.5) not available on the internet, at least I haven't found anything.

So, first, gps is provided by two services on iOS:

gps service: com.apple.gpsd

gps service executable: /usr/libexec/gpsd

gps service plist file (fake): /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.gpsd.plist

I say ""fake"" above, because all services (including xpc) are controlled by this file:

    /System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist

location service: com.apple.locationd

location service executable: /usr/libexec/locationd

location service plist file (fake): /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist

Both services are required for gps. I am saying this for those people who consider disabling useless services, don't disable the two. Also, do NOT disable the ""com.apple.timed"" service, because it is somehow required for timestamps used by GPS (even if automatic time setting is disabled in Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Date &amp; Time!). Because if you do disable the ""com.apple.timed"" service, iOS will fail to enter ""Hot"" TTFF mode, as described here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\_to\_first\_fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_fix)

This is how I tested.

* Disabled ""com.apple.timed"":launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.timed.plist
* Launched google maps in the open (clear sky, i.e., no obstruction above), WITHOUT having an internet connection, waited for gps to acquire Time to first fix (s.a.) and my precise location. Now put the phone into lock mode (dark screen). Waited two minutes without moving. Opened google maps again. Should be a hot start (should lock on my location in just a few seconds). Took over 40 seconds to get precise location. Repeat, always the same.

Then re-enabled ""com.apple.timed"":

    launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.timed.plist

Launched google maps, waited for it to lock on my precise location. Put the phone into lock mode, waited for a couple of minutes, even moved away half a kilometre. Opened google maps, and it locked on my precise location in 10-20 seconds, repeat, same behaviour.

As long as you haven't acquired the ""first fix"" and you don't have an internet connection or you have blocked the domains used by iOS for A-GPS (thru ""/private/etc/hosts"" file or whatever), all apps that rely on gps behave very weirdly:

1. The status bar icon indicating gps activity appears on the SpringBoard (""SpringBoard"" is the iOS ""desktop"") in the upper left corner (iOS 16) if you enable it (Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Location Services -&gt; System Services -&gt; Status Bar Icon), but will disappear after 10 seconds, even if google maps, compass or any other app relying on gps is in the foreground). Minimising google maps and bringing it back into foreground again will make the status bar icon re-appear, but again, just for 10 seconds.
2. If you disable Location Services completely (Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Location Services) thru the gui, then re-enable them (or disable + re-enable ""com.apple.locationd"" service), and iOS doesn't have access to A-GPS servers (e.g., you don't have internet connection), all apps will behave even more weirdly until ""first fix"" is acquired:

google maps will throw you to some random place (usually the ocean, lol, probably latitude: -1, longitude: -1), clicking the ""center on me"" button inside the google maps gui (blue arrow on white background) will yield the following message:

    Location could not be determined

Also, there's no dot for your location AT ALL.

Compass app will freeze when opened, waiting for the first fix. It looks as if it crashed. Will not display orientation or latitude + longitude.

This happens, because ""com.apple.locationd"" won't answer until it acquires the first fix.

If you have the first fix, but it's outdated and needs to be refreshed, but you don't have an internet connection, google maps may show a GREY dot for your location instead of the usual blue dot. If you click (touch) on the grey dot, google maps gui will display various messages like:

    Location is out of date. Your location was updated XXX min ago \\n This might be due to weak GPS or Wi-Fi signals.

Btw, these locale strings are located the google maps install directory:

    /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/GoogleMaps\_GUID/maps.app/AppResources.bundle/en.lproj/App.strings

You need to convert the file to XML to make it readable (plutil, jlutil, plu, plistutil, plconvert command-line utils can do it). I searched for these messages on the internet, but google finds nothing. Weird.

This weird behaviour will continue until the ""first fix"" is acquired. So if google maps or the Compass app look broken / frozen / crashed, they are not. Despite the fact that the status bar icon is not displayed (even if enabled in the settings - s.a.), ""com.apple.gpsd"" IS working to acquire the first fix. On an iPhone X it takes exactly 3 minutes to acquire the fix in ""Cold"" mode. Note that newer smartphones may take less due to dual frequency (starting with iPhone 14 Pro, and only on Galileo / Chinese satellites currently):

Gps is not updating properly when the iPhone is locked (or no apps that rely on GPS are in the foreground). This may be different if you have ""Find My"" installed, but I uninstalled it. So if you move around or don't use gps apps and some time passes, then open google maps etc., iOS will have to re-lock on your location. I don't know if you can force the gps services to track your location continuously without having gps apps in the foreground. This saves battery, I guess, but it also increases the time to lock on you. I can tell you from experience, you move 40 km away from your location (on the internet, they say 50 miles, but that's not true) or let ca. 2 hours pass without activating gps, and your ""first fix"" is gone, you will have to wait for 3 minutes again unless you have an internet connection (so rely purely on traditional gps instead of A-GPS).

So how does iOS A-GPS work? There's some info on Android gps out there:

[https://divestos.org/misc/gnss.txt](https://divestos.org/misc/gnss.txt)

[https://grapheneos.org/faq](https://grapheneos.org/faq)

but unfortunately hardly any info on iOS. Overall, ""A-GPS"" is a very broad term, how it's implemented, depends on the manufacturer. So here's what I found out:

1. Acquiring the almanac (ephemeris too?) over the internet. All almanacs seem to have the same name, both on iOS and Android, they are called ""lto2.dat"". However, there's a second file, called ""rtistatus.dat"", may be also called ""rtistatus4.dat"" or ""rtistatus5.dat"". The download locations for both files are defined inside:/private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/cache.plist

You need to convert it to XML to make it readable:

    plutil -convert xml1 /private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/cache.plist

Inside, look for ""lto2.dat"" or ""rtistatus"". Here's what mine says:

    &lt;key&gt;FileUpdate.https://iphone-ld.apple.com/lto/7day/v5/latest/lto2.dat&lt;/key&gt;
    
    &lt;real&gt;740463576.72455335&lt;/real&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;key&gt;FileUpdate.https://iphone-ld.apple.com/lto/rtistatus4.dat&lt;/key&gt;
    
    &lt;real&gt;740490139.9766922&lt;/real&gt;

The weird timestamp is in Mac absolute time format:

[https://www.epochconverter.com/coredata](https://www.epochconverter.com/coredata)

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57521167](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57521167)

If you convert it to unix timestamp and then human-readable format, it simply displays the last download time of the files (so identical to ""last modified"" timestamp in bash if you run ""ls"").

If you block ""iphone-ld.apple.com"" server, e.g. thru ""hosts:

    0.0.0.0 iphone-ld.apple.com
    ::0 iphone-ld.apple.com

you will have to acquire ""first fix"" thru traditional gps (3 minutes!) Plus ""Warm""/""Hot"" startups will take much longer (27-45 seconds without a recent almanac vs. 5 seconds for a ""warm"" startup with the most recent almanac downloaded off the Apple server)

However, there are further ""lto2.dat"" and ""rtistatus"" on Apple servers, don't know what they are for, probably depends on your iPhone model / iOS version. E.g.:

[https://iphone-ld.apple.com/lto/7day/v7/latest/lto2.dat](https://iphone-ld.apple.com/lto/7day/v7/latest/lto2.dat)

[https://iphone-ld.apple.com/lto/a/rtistatus5.dat](https://iphone-ld.apple.com/lto/a/rtistatus5.dat)

Older phones used to use:

[https://iphone-wu.apple.com/7day/v2/latest/lto2.dat](https://iphone-wu.apple.com/7day/v2/latest/lto2.dat)

There are some other urls listed inside ""cache.plist"":

Used for bluetooth A-GPS?:

[https://configuration.apple.com/configurations/internetservices/bt/bcw.plist.gz](https://configuration.apple.com/configurations/internetservices/bt/bcw.plist.gz)

[https://configuration.apple.com/configurations/internetservices/bt/bcwv.plist](https://configuration.apple.com/configurations/internetservices/bt/bcwv.plist)

No idea what this nonsense is:

[https://cl3.apple.com/1/v2/clsef.bin.gz](https://cl3.apple.com/1/v2/clsef.bin.gz)

[https://cl3.apple.com/2/v1/clhrseavl.avl.gz](https://cl3.apple.com/2/v1/clhrseavl.avl.gz)

[https://cl4.apple.com/2/m2/a.1//availability.pb.gz](https://cl4.apple.com/2/m2/a.1//availability.pb.gz)

All files listed inside cache.plist are downloaded to the main locationd cache directory:

    /private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/

Note that once iOS downloads the ""rtistatus4.dat"" or ""rtistatus5.dat"" or whatever is listed in your ""cache.plist"", it will rename it to ""rti.dat"". All \*.gz will be unpacked once downloaded (and of course Apple is too stupid to delete the \*.gz files after extraction, wasting your storage space).

There's hardly any info on these two files. ""lto2.dat"" contains the almanac. Does it contain ephemerides too? Hell if I know. The ""lto2.dat"" is rather big - appr. 180KB on Apple server, Android files are smaller. Why? Hell if I know. ""RTI"" stands for ""Realtime Integrity""... I think. What does ""Realtime Integrity"" mean? Hell if I know. ""lto2"" stands for ""Long Time Orbit"". What does ""Long Time Orbit"" mean? Hell if I know. The files are unreadable, supposedly scrambled using XXTEA:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXTEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXTEA)

Question: How often does iOS update the almanac? Of course, nobody on the entire internet ever bothered to find out. From my experience I can tell you, the RTI file ist re-downloaded exactly once every hour (if you have internet connection, obviously, and the domain is not blocked), as far as ""lto2.dat"" is concerned - unsure, need to check further. Last time my iOS updated (re-downloaded) it exactly 12 hours after the previous download. But maybe the ""RTI"" file contains some info on the state of the almanac? So maybe iOS downloads ""RTI"" file first, if this file says a new almanac is available, iOS will attempt to re-download ""lto2.dat"" as well? Just a guess, because, as I said, these files are encoded, so hell knows what the ""RTI"" file contains.

If you want to force iOS to re-download the almanac immediately, you can either disable, then re-enable the Location Services thru the gui, or restart gps/location servers (don't know if you have to restart both, haven't tested):

    launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.gpsd.plist
    
    
    
    launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist
    
    
    
    launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.gpsd.plist
    
    
    
    launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist

The RTI file is very small (just a few bytes), the ""lto2"" file is much larger. Why is the almanac spread over two files both on iOS and Android? Hell if I know.

2) iOS a-GPS also includes Wi-Fi positioning system / network location provider (NLP):

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi\_positioning\_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system)

This function basically connects to the following Apple server:

[https://gs-loc.apple.com/clls/wloc](https://gs-loc.apple.com/clls/wloc)

to acquire your location by sending Apple some Wifi Mac in your vicinity. Apple replies with the Wifi's latitude + longitude:

[https://www.appelsiini.net/2017/reverse-engineering-location-services/](https://www.appelsiini.net/2017/reverse-engineering-location-services/)

If you block the ""gs-loc.apple.com"" server or don't have an internet connection and you are inside a building (no clear sight to the satellites), iOS will fail to find you!

How does Apple know the Wifi device location? Well, all Apple devices send your location to Apple's servers, so they have a database of MACs and their latitude + longitude. Talking about privacy. But how does an iPhone know the location of a Wifi device in the first place, I mean, BEFORE it's added to Apple's database? Seems it works like this: iOS acquires your location by traditional gps (thru satellites). Then, when you get in the vicinity of a wifi device, iOS will calculate its location based on YOUR location (i.e., iPhone's location) modified by wifi signal strength of the wifi device, then sends this data to Apple. Also, iOS will sometimes add this info to:

    /private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/cache\_encryptedB.db

This is a simple SQL file, check ""LteCellLocation"" table (saves mobile towers together with their latitude + longitude) and ""WifiLocation"" table (wifi devices complete with their MAC + latitude + longitude + timestamp).

Note that not all wifi devices are saved to the SQL file. How iOS decides which MACs to save and which not? Hell if I know. However, if a specific MAC has been added to ""cache\_encryptedB.db"", next time you will get in the vicinity of that wifi device, iOS will find your location immediately, even if you do NOT have ""first fix"", it will simply look up the MAC's latitude + longitude in the table, so no internet connection is required.

Note that ""cache\_encryptedB.db"" is emptied if you disable Location Services thru the gui. It's NOT emptied, if you simply restart the ""com.apple.gpsd"" and ""com.apple.locationd"" or crash the executables (in which case the services will restart them):

    killall gpsd
    
    
    
    killall locationd

Note that NLP does NOT reduce TTFF !!! This is mentioned here:

[https://divestos.org/misc/gnss.txt](https://divestos.org/misc/gnss.txt)

and I can confirm that this is the case. If you are in the vicinity of a Wifi device listed in ""cache\_encryptedB.db"", iOS will display your precise location immediately. Now lock the iPhone or just don't use any gps apps, move outside the reach of the known Wifi device, and if you have an outdated almanac and no internet connection, it will take the full ""Cold"" TTFF to find your location.

Note that NLP sometimes fails to work. So you enter a building (shop, airport etc.), iOS can't find your precise location (large blue aura around the blue dot in Google Maps), because no clear sight to the satellites and no internet connection. Now login into some well-known Wifi network. Now that you are logged, iOS should contact ""gs-loc.apple.com"" to get the MAC's location. Sometimes it does, sometimes it fails. You can force it to do this by restarting the ""com.apple.gpsd"" and ""com.apple.locationd"" services.

3) Does iOS utilise mobile (cellular) towers to find your location? I am not sure, at least on my iPhone it doesn't work properly. Here's what I read for Android devices:

[https://grapheneos.org/faq](https://grapheneos.org/faq)

    When you have both a cellular connection and Location enabled, control plane and/or user plane (SUPL) A-GNSS is used in addition to PSDS to greatly reduce the time needed for GNSS to obtain an initial location lock. These obtain coarse location info from a server based on nearby cell towers.

No idea what this nonsense means, but if you are interested, look here:

[https://www.sharetechnote.com/Docs/WP-LTE-positioning.pdf](https://www.sharetechnote.com/Docs/WP-LTE-positioning.pdf)

    Control Plane protocol -&gt; aGPS over wireless broadband communication. LTE: LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) + LPP Annex (LPPa). No internet connection required ?
    
    
    
    Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) protocol -&gt; TCP/IP
    
    
    
    	Mobile Station Assisted (MSA)
    
    
    
    	Mobile Station Based (MSB)

As mentioned above, the ""cache\_encryptedB.db"" SQL file includes an ""LteCellLocation"" table. What's it used for? Hell if I know.

When you install iOS on a fresh iPhone, the ""com.apple.locationd"" cache directory will contain some files in the following places:

    /private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/adsf
    
    
    
    /private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/tiles\_cell/coarse-lte

Seems the ""adsf"" contains multiple cell tower locations, while the ""coarse-lte"" will contain the cell tower files for the tower your iPhone is connected to (two files, one of them is the timestamp inside a \*.plist file, the other - cell tower location ?). However, if you disable Location Services thru the gui, all files in those directories are deleted. If you re-enable the Location Services, they are NOT restored on my iPhone. Hell knows where iOS gets them from. The only way I was able to get those files is by creating a backup of iOS in iTunes, then restoring the backup immediately afterwards. However, again, if you disable Location Services thru the gui, they are gone for good.

You can restore those files manually by backuping the two files inside the ""coarse-lte"" directory, disabling, then re-enabling the Location Services thru the gui, disabling the ""com.apple.locationd"", putting the two files back into the ""coarse-lte"" and re-enabling the ""com.apple.locationd"" service. However! These files have a valid duration based on the timestamp (the \*.plist file inside the ""coarse-lte"" directory). Those files are valid for a number of months (180 days?). Afterwards, they are deleted even if you put them manually into the ""coarse-lte"" directory, once you restart the ""com.apple.locationd"" service, locationd will delete them. What's the url Apple downloads these files from? Again, nobody knows... except for Apple, and they are not telling anything. When are these files downloaded? How often re-downloaded? No idea, and nobody else knows except for Apple.

If the files inside ""coarse-lte"" directory are present (and not outdated yet) and iOS doesn't have the ""first fix"", nor are there any known wifi devices in the vicinity, nor do you have an internet connection, iOS will position your iPhone at the cell tower's location. So in Google Maps you will see the blue dot somewhere at the cell tower with a HUGE blue aura around the dot. This is NOT helpful, because the cell tower can be 50 km away from your location, and iOS doesn't seem to adjust the location. Maybe it depends on the number of cell towers around you for triangulation purposes. If there's just one, iOS will throw you to its location, and as long as your precise location is not acquired, google maps will be useless, because obviously, when navigating with google maps you want the app to tell you how to get to some location from YOUR location, not from the cell tower's location. Besides, as long as your precise location is not acquired, the blue dot will simply be stuck in the place of the cell tower and won't budge. In my case, iOS threw me to another city, 30 km away from my location. The future is now! You better make sure you have a paper atlas with you.

If the ""coarse-lte"" directory is empty, you don't have an internet connection, and you don't have the ""first fix"" (or iOS hasn't locked yet on your precise location), you will either get a grey dot in google maps, or all gps apps will behave totally weirdly, waiting for the GPS services to first get the ""first fix"", then get your precise location (see above).

On Androids, there's something called ""Predicted Satellite Data Service"" (PSDS). No idea what this is or if Apple has something similar.

""A-GPS"" is also referred to as:

    Assisted GNSS (global navigation satellite system)
    
    A-GNSS
    
    aGPS
    
    supported GPS

in case you need some keywords to search for.

If disabling ""location services"" thru ""Settings"" app, ""locationd"" executable may start hogging the CPU (100% usage). Probably trying to access some services that are disabled (in case you are like me and like disabling crap services, lol). No idea why this happens, but killing the ""locationd"" executable:

    killall locationd

will fix it (the locationd service will restart the executable, which will no longer hog the CPU). If you want to monitor what locationd service does, try this:

    cat /private/var/log/com.apple.xpc.launchd/launchd.log | grep -i 'locationd'

Not sure if iOS has this. Haven't used iOS since I was a kid. But on Android (Samsung specifically), for example, if I am running a timer, a persistant, non-dismissable notification will appear in the notification shade showing how much time is remaining and gives me access to certain actions like adding time, stopping the timer, etc. 

The only difference with dynamic island, from the perspective of someone who has never used it, is that it sits at the top of your screen and allows you to glance at the information without swiping down to get the notification shade. 

However, if I wanted to get access to that information at a glance I can just add it to a widget, which can also be accessed with a swipe gesture. For example, the ""widget panel"" on Samsung allows me to add widgets to the edge panels which are accessible with a quick swipe.

I should note my background is of *exclusive* use of the Android market since 2014...ran stock AOSP and alternate ROM packages along my solid MBP whose Nvidia logic board crapped out in 2017...remained on Android without a computer base since...upgraded Android hardware in 2020 to the MIUI-AOSP universe without chromeOS hardware inclusion because it's more expensive than macOS!

2021-10-29,1635482563,"The iPhone 13 Is Almost Perfect, But We Need To Chat About iOS","Greetings iOS/Apple sub,

I posted a variant of this post on the Samsung Galaxy S10 sub and it was suggested that I cross-post here, so here are my thoughts after a few weeks of use with my iPhone 13 Mini. 

Some background before I start: Ive been an Apple user for about 10 years, was a devout iPhone 4 owner (which to me is still one of the best phones of all time), Ive been a Mac owner for four years, and I owned the iPhone 6s for about three years before switching to the Samsung S10e in 2019. At the time (2019) the cheaper S10e absolutely blew the iPhone XR out of the water with an OLED screen vs the iPhones low-res LCD panel, faster processor, fast charging and USB-C, making it an obvious upgrade from my iPhone 6s at the time. Although I really enjoyed the Android experience over two years, its no secret that iPhones are more optimised on certain apps. Being a photographer, Ive also been really attracted to the iPhone cameras, and I still rate the iPhone 6s camera as one of my favourite mobile shooters. So, with the release of the iPhone 13 Mini, I thought that I would make the switch back to Apple. Ive had this 13 Mini for about three weeks, and I thought I would give you my thoughts on what its been like switching between the two platforms and the two devices, starting with what I love about this iPhone 13 Mini.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Good**

This is yet another beautifully machined device from Apple. Everything looks and feels premium. I love the size, particularly as Im outdoors a lot, I cycle and run, so this makes it ideal for carrying around. Airdrop gets an honourable mention as it certainly does make file transfer a lot easier, as does Spotlight search, an Apple staple which is executed particularly well on the new iPhones. The dedicated app library is also a long overdue on iOS but welcome addition, as it means I dont have to clutter up my home screen with essential but unwanted apps. 

Apples chips are superb, particularly the way they optimise the balance between performance and battery life. As mentioned above, Apple cameras have by far had the best optics of most cellphone cameras over the years and I feel the 13 Mini is no exception. My Samsung S10e would blow out highlights and didnt have a very good portrait mode, and to have that level of processing power in such a small phone like the Mini is simply insane. I also have no idea what Apple did with the battery but it was a massively pleasant surprise on this phone, to be able to charge up fully in around 45mins or less and get a full day of heavy usage. Im afraid thats where it ends though, because coming from Android, Ive found the iPhone to be an extremely frustrating daily experience

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bad**

In the points Ive just mentioned, youll notice that I talk mostly about hardware, the cameras, battery, design, processing power - all elements of this phone which have been engineered by Apple. The software experience though, has been the diametric opposite, and I would go so far as to say that for all Apples hardware innovation and advancement, their mobile software simply hasnt been able to keep up, either that or theyve refused to keep up with Android. Please keep in mind that Im viewing all of iOSs shortcomings through the lens of an Android power user whos become used to a particular operating philosophy, and the old adage of being the system administrator on Android and simply an end user rings very true when coming from an Android device. The following areas are where I think iOS fails to get it right:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Notifications**

There is a huge difference in how Android shows notifications and important information compared to iOS. One of the reasons I got the iPhone 13 was for the smaller notch (which in itself is disappointing considering were in 2021 and hole punch screens look far better), but to see that Apple havent put any extra information in this space is even more disappointing. The fact that I cant even see my battery percentage at a glance is a nagging inconvenience. The way that Android groups notifications is so much more intuitive, with a single notifications bubble on the screen which expands if tapped on, compared to iOSs current archaic Notifications Centre. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Control Centre**

The control centre is also a place where not much has development has taken place. Coming from Android, where the control centre and notifications are integrated has also made it frustrating to have these two elements of the OS separated, with separate swipes to access both areas. To be fair, I dont think the Control Centre is bad, but again, you compare it to the Android experience and everything there is just so much more accessible and customisable.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. The home screen grid**

To be beholden to Apples iOS home screen snap-grid layout in 2021 should surely be a crime against humanity. I should not have to download a transparent widgets to have my icons laid out the way I want to.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Customization**

On that note, the lack of customisation is another sore point for me. Coming over to iOS, I had seen what customisation was possible on iOS 14, but it is probably easier to perform heart surgery than set up custom screens and icons on iOS. Android? The launchers and icon packs available now are not only about a 10th of the price of iOS icon packs, but theyre far more refined and easier to implement. For a long time I used Nova Launcher on Android but Ive recently started playing with Niagara launcher, a gorgeous alternative. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Widgets**

Again, a lot was made of widgets on iOS 14. Little does Apple tell you that widgets are simply glorified icons. Big screen elements which display info and not much else. They dont really perform any custom tasks or provide any interactive elements.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. The default Photos app** 

The default Android gallery is not pretty nor is it not fancy, but it is functional. I can see, in specific folders, where my content is housed. Save a video from Google Drive? It puts it in a folder called Google Drive. Export an image from Canva? Find it in the Canva folder. It simply makes sense. Compare that to the iOS Album gallery which by default dumps all your images and video into the Recents folder and then insists on segmenting your media first by My Albums, then People and Places and finally Media Types. Both the Library and For You modules in the Photos app are of pretty much zero use to me as far as indexing goes. This incoherent excuse for a photo app makes it difficult to locate media at speed and means I end up combing through hundreds of images to find that one that Im looking for. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Opening the home screen from Face ID**

Ive canvassed some opinions on this and longtime iOS users seem to be perfectly content with having to swipe up to unlock their phones even after Face ID has verified their identity. For me, this was a jarring experience, as any touch on my Samsungs fingerprint reader or face unlock would unlock directly to the home screen without any extra gesture. This is completely a matter of personal preference, and I understand that, but as someone who opens their phone more proactively rather than reactively, I would much more prefer the option to have Face ID open directly to home screen rather than another unnecessary swipe. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are absolutely some hardware omissions that I cannot ignore, like USB-C and a fingerprint reader, but those are omissions I am willing to live with. I suppose the silver lining is that because these are mostly software gripes that I have with iOS, they can be fixed in future updates, but Im personally not holding my breath about this, as Apples philosophy around these things seem to be insistently stubborn.

The question I keep asking myself is, are all these software faults worth the upgrade in camera quality and battery performance, and I would say yes - the quality of content I am able to capture with this device surpasses anything else available right now. But having said that, the days of iOS being the intuitive mobile operating system are over and coming from the freedom and speed of Android is extremely frustrating and limiting experience. Ive slowly come to accept the software flaws of iOS and work around them given that the iPhone 13 Mini hardware more than makes up for it, but I do think that iOS has lots of work to do in catching up to Android.",ios,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/qi4vvg/the_iphone_13_is_almost_perfect_but_we_need_to/,pro_ios,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,
2021-06-05,1622928980,New to iOS,Ive had my 1st iPhone (12 Pro Max) for nearly a month after using the Android platform for many years. I am learning that iOS doesnt allow you to copy/paste multiple items to the clipboard. Only the last item copied can be pasted. Is there an App that allows this? It seems like a simple process that iOS should adapt. I am aware that both platforms have their advantages as well as their shortcomings so I dont want this to turn into an iOS vs Android debate.

2019-10-18,1571413340,"Coming from Android. Good, Bad, &amp; Questions.","Hi all,

I come in peace!  I never wanted an iPhone, but my company stopped using Androids, so iPhone it is.  I had a LOT of anxiety about this, and the first hour was hell, but after a couple of days, I'm actually loving it!  I should have upgraded a while ago!  It's an iPhone XR, and I'm on iOS 13.1.3.

I've been compiling some thoughts in a document.  Rather than a list of questions, it's more a list of what I've found to be good and bad, but I would like to think that some of the items in my Bad section, are just things I haven't figured out how to do yet, so I'd love some help on those if possible.

Just so this isn't a list of negatives (remember, I do love it!), here's what I've got in my Good list:

* Battery life is incredible

* FaceID is fast &amp; accurate, and I'm so glad I don't have to deal with a PIN any more!

* Talk to Text works well

* Swipe works well (I'm so glad Apple added this; couldn't live without it!)

* I think I've been able to remove most bloatware

* I had reservations about the screen because of the low resolution/PPI, and the blacks because it's LCD, but it's actually really good

* My emoji dude mimicking my expressions had me laughing uncontrollably

* Overall, the performance/speed of the phone is excellent

Now my Bad.  Some of these are written as statements, but again, I'd like to think that in some cases, I just haven't figured out things yet.  I'll number these for reference in case anyone wants to respond:

1. It requires 2 motions to close an app **I've mostly just stopped closing apps**
2. You cannot close all apps at once **I've mostly just stopped closing apps**
3. I have to go to a different keyboard to get to commonly used characters such as commas  **Solution from r/ReliableSource - hold/slide/release - works well**
4. The headphones are incredibly uncomfortable
5. I cannot charge and use headphones at the same time.  **I bought a two way adapter for this**
6. I cannot make an icon a widget on my main screen (Shazam, Alexa, etc) - these are only on a separate widgets screen?
7. Reddit is Fun is not available for iPhone (I'm trying out Apollo and Narwhal for now...)
8. I cannot drag and drop MP3's onto the phone in Windows Explorer.  Am I forced to use iTunes for this?  **Started using iTunes.  It's okay, but unnecessary**
9. The Notch is horrendous and the thick all round bezel makes the phone look outdated
10. No optical zoom
11. Can only pay with phone where Apple Pay is available (Samsung was anywhere you could use a credit card)
12. Cannot set alarm volume to slowly increase
13. Volume controls are not intuitive; cannot set Ring, Media, Notification volumes in once place
14. No separate icon for Outlook Calendar (I know this isn't unique to iPhone)
15. No 3.5mm headphone jack (I know this is becoming the norm for high end Android now too).  **I bought a two way adapter for this**
16. Can't multi-task with split screen
17. Can't add favorite contacts to top of contacts list

Some other specific things I'm wondering about:

Q1:  Chrome vs Safari, and if I use Safari, is it possible for bookmarks to Sync with Chrome automatically, since I use Chrome everywhere else?

Q2:  Thoughts on Apple Maps vs Google Maps?  Have used Google Maps for years.

Q3:  Already listed above, but what is the best way to manage my MP3's?  On Android, I'd just connect my phone to my PC, and drag MP3's into my phone's music folder via Windows Explorer, then they'd play in Google Play Music.  Not that I understand iTunes very well, but I'm not enthusiastic about it.  Should I use it, or should I use something else?  **Stated using iTunes &amp; Apple Music.  Not ideal, but it works**

2019-12-28,1577554708,Question: Calendar management Google vs. iCloud,"Hi all,

I've been in Android for almost 10 years until a couple of months and tried to have everything non-iOS native into Google for an easier transition.

I like to be very organised in terms of reminders and calendar and I've always used Google Calendar for things such as organising my own events, invite other people and so on. I am wondering what the benefits and cons are if I go 100% on my iCloud account for just the calendar.

\- Invite others to events  
\- Have access to event addresses (I realised yesterday that I can't use the address of an event IÂ´ve been invited to \[Google to Google\] when using CarPlay)

I can't really think of any other things at the moment but might be useful to mention I am a Mac user as well for half of my work duties and 100% personal use.

Thank you very much beforehand and merry Christmas to all! ;)",ios,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/egtkef/question_calendar_management_google_vs_icloud/,neutral,Stance: pro_android,,,,,,,,

2016-09-21,1474434749,Jailbreaking vs. Updating?,"I'll be switching from a very crappy but rooted Android phone in a few days back to my first true love (iOS device lol). Considering that my old phone was rooted, you can probably guess I also usually use jailbroken iPhones. So I just would like some opinions as I cannot make up my mind.

Who here would rather have a Jailbroken iOS 9.3.3 over iOS 10? I'll be getting a new iPhone 5s because it's killer cheap, and I hear iOS 10 runs smooth as butter and has a ton of cool new features. Also, you cannot use AirPods without having iOS 10, which could be a drawback as I love the look of them and I'm in favour of Bluetooth headphones.

On the other hand, I love having so many options and tweaks with a Jailbroken device. I don't use a crap ton like some people, but I do likethe ability to do so many things on my device.

I just wanted some opinions and secondary input.
